This allows the users to release these buffers as fast as possible.Modification:- Change the Bzip2Decoder to do the decompression of data in a streaming fashion.- Add some safety check to ensure the block length never execeeds the maximum (as defined in the spec)Result:No more risk of an OOME by decompress some large data via bzip2.Thanks to Ori Hollander of JFrog Security for reporting the issue.(we got acquired during the process and now Vdoo is part of JFrog company),1

[3.1.x] Fixed CVE-2021-35042 -- Prevented SQL injection in QuerySet.o… …rder_by().Regression introduced in 5139487by marking the raw SQL column reference feature for deprecation inDjango 4.0 while lifting the column format validation.In retrospective the validation should have been kept around and theuser should have been pointed at using RawSQL expressions during thedeprecation period.The main branch is not affected because the raw SQL column referencesupport has been removed in 06eec31per the 4.0 deprecation life cycle.Thanks Joel Saunders for the report.,1

"[BUGFIX] Mark broken links in RTE againThe possibility to mark broken links with the `data-rte-error`attribute and styling was removed in TYPO3 v12.This is now added again to allow for linkvalidator and otherextensions to mark broken links which will then be visiblystyled differently when editing in the RTE.This affects only the backend. The attribute data-rte-error isremoved when persisting the content to the database.The logic for adding this attribute is still in place:The linkvalidator uses the event `BrokenLinkAnalysisEvent`which is dispatched in `RteHtmlParser`.A marked broken link may look like this:```html<a href=""t3://page?uid=42""  data-rte-error=""External link is broken"">link</a>```Note that the functionality got disabled with the new ckeditorin #96874 while the implementing plugin ""showbrokenlinks"" wasremoved later with #98497. The CSS is therefore restored fromthe state as of before #98497.Resolves: #101357Related: #96874Related: #98497Releases: main, 12.4Change-Id: I898b1de1b9bb9bf334740dc3b7ec8eb70627bed4Reviewed-on: https://review.typo3.org/c/Packages/TYPO3.CMS/+/80035Tested-by: Benjamin Franzke <ben@bnf.dev>Reviewed-by: Stefan Bürk <stefan@buerk.tech>Tested-by: core-ci <typo3@b13.com>Reviewed-by: Benjamin Franzke <ben@bnf.dev>Tested-by: Stefan Bürk <stefan@buerk.tech>",1

"Fix unsoundness in ImmediateIO and TransactionalIO, aka RUSTSEC-2020-… …0152 aka#1.Unsafe impls of Sync for both of these structs are removed, and Send bounds areintroduced where necessary to allow Sync to be properly deduced instead.The unsafe impls were introduced due to an incorrect analysis of why Sync wasnot being auto-deduced as expected for these structs. The removed commentexplains the original flawed analysis, which attributed it to the presence of astruct member of type PhantomData<EI>, under the assumption that the only""real"" value of type EI in the struct is ultimately inside an IOMutex thatshould bless it with Sync-ness regardless if EI is itself Sync.In fact, Sync was not being deduced due to the absence of a *Send* bound on thetype EI, which is required for Expander<EI> to be Send, which is required forIOMutex<Expander<EI>> to be *Sync*. The presence of the PhantomData<EI> memberturns out to be entirely irrelevant.The bug could theoretically result in a data race if either type is used withan EI that is not safe to send between threads.This is a breaking change due to the addition of a trait bound in the publicAPI.",1

That stopped further filereference processing in the ext:lowlevel cleanup command`cleanup:missingrelations`.Therefore, this change explicitly catches the concrete`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Resource\Exception\FileDoesNotExistException`exception and outputs the message, without interrupting theprocessing of further files.The handling code is moved to a dedicated method to cleanup code duplication on the same step as a side-change.Other unforeseen errors still stop the execution.Resolves: #101924Releases: main, 12.4Change-Id: I2c8dba34a6f99d891408b5cc8fd86bddcb3c90c2Reviewed-on: https://review.typo3.org/c/Packages/TYPO3.CMS/+/81024Tested-by: core-ci <typo3@b13.com>Reviewed-by: Benni Mack <benni@typo3.org>Tested-by: Benni Mack <benni@typo3.org>Reviewed-by: Oliver Klee <typo3-coding@oliverklee.de>Tested-by: Stefan Bürk <stefan@buerk.tech>Reviewed-by: Stefan Bürk <stefan@buerk.tech>",1

"[TASK] Remove superfluous code in ext:feloginWith #98370, all occurrences of `setOriginalRequestMappingResults()`have been replaced with the reassignment of the global Extbaserequest object attached with a modified `Result` object.This is however not required and has no effect, since in allcases, an Extbase `ForwardResponse` is returned, which includesthe modified `Result` object. The `Result` object is then usedin Extbase Dispatcher to build the new Extbase request object,which then is redispatched.This change therefore removes the superfluous Extbase requestobject assignments in `PasswordRecoveryController`.Additionally, the variable name for the original result hasbeen streamlined to `$originalResult`.Resolves: #102112Releases: mainSigned-off-by: Torben Hansen <derhansen@gmail.com>Change-Id: I28cdc69d2772dc87543a39d13305be610ee94a54Reviewed-on: https://review.typo3.org/c/Packages/TYPO3.CMS/+/81372Reviewed-by: Christian Kuhn <lolli@schwarzbu.ch>Tested-by: core-ci <typo3@b13.com>Tested-by: Stefan Bürk <stefan@buerk.tech>Reviewed-by: Stefan Bürk <stefan@buerk.tech>Tested-by: Christian Kuhn <lolli@schwarzbu.ch>",0

"CVE-2021-41146: Add --untrusted-args to avoid argument injection On Windows, if an application is registered as an URL handler like this:    HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT        https            URL Protocol = """"            [...]            shell                open                    command                    (Default) = "".../qutebrowser.exe"" ""%1""one would think that Windows takes care of making sure URLs can't injectarguments by containing a quote. However, this is not the case, asstated by the Microsoft docs:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/internet-explorer/ie-developer/platform-apis/aa767914(v=vs.85)    Security Warning: Applications that handle URI schemes must consider how to    respond to malicious data. Because handler applications can receive data    from untrusted sources, the URI and other parameter values passed to the    application may contain malicious data that attempts to exploit the handling    application.and    As noted above, the string that is passed to a pluggable protocol handler    might be broken across multiple parameters. Malicious parties could use    additional quote or backslash characters to pass additional command line    parameters. For this reason, pluggable protocol handlers should assume that    any parameters on the command line could come from malicious parties, and    carefully validate them. Applications that could initiate dangerous actions    based on external data must first confirm those actions with the user. In    addition, handling applications should be tested with URIs that are overly    long or contain unexpected (or undesirable) character sequences.Indeed it's trivial to pass a command to qutebrowser this way - given howtrivial the exploit is to recreate given the information above, here's a PoC:    https:x"" "":spawn calc(or qutebrowserurl: instead of https: if qutebrowser isn't registered as adefault browser)Some applications do escape the quote characters before callingqutebrowser - but others, like Outlook Desktop or .url files, do not.As a fix, we add an --untrusted-args flag and some early validation of the rawsys.argv, before parsing any arguments or e.g. creating a QApplication (whichmight already allow injecting Qt flags there).We assume that there's no way for an attacker to inject flags *before* the %1placeholder in the registry, and add --untrusted-args as the last argument ofthe registry entry. This way, it'd still be possible for users to customizetheir invocation flags without having to remove --untrusted-args.After --untrusted-args, however, we have some rather strict checks:- There should be zero or one arguments, but not two (or more)- Any argument may not start with - (flag) or : (qutebrowser command)We also add the --untrusted-args flag to the Linux .desktop file, though itshould not be needed there, as the specification there is sane:https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-latest.html#exec-variables    Implementations must take care not to expand field codes into multiple    arguments unless explicitly instructed by this specification. This means    that name fields, filenames and other replacements that can contain spaces    must be passed as a single argument to the executable program after    expansion.There is no comparable mechanism on macOS, which opens the application withoutarguments and then sends an ""open"" event to it:https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qfileopenevent.htmlThis issue was introduced in qutebrowser v1.7.0 which started registering it asURL handler: baee288 / #4086This is by no means an issue isolated to qutebrowser.

"Disable graphql-upload integration when it is not used (#6476) By default, we run the graphql-upload middleware on all requests. Thismiddleware is vulnerable to mutation CSRF attacks because it parses POSTrequests with `content-type: multipart/form-data`, which can happen in anon-preflighted browser request. (Without graphql-upload, Apollo Serverwon't process any mutations in non-preflighted requests, becausemutations must be in POST requests and normally that requires`content-type: application/json` which must be preflighted.)In order to safely use graphql-upload, you should upgrade to ApolloServer v3.7 and use its new CSRF prevention feature. Because ApolloServer 2 is not under active development we do not intend to backportthe full CSRF prevention feature to AS2.However, we at least want to protect the users of Apollo Server 2 who*don't* actually need graphql-upload to be enabled (which is probablymost of them). This PR changes the default behavior of Apollo Server 2when no `uploads` parameter is passed. Instead of always executing thegraphql-upload middleware in this case, we only execute it if the`Upload` scalar (which may be added automatically to the schema by ASitself or may be provided by the user) is referenced somewhere in theschema other than its own definition. This should be roughlybackwards-compatible; it only breaks the ability to use a`graphql-upload`-based client with Apollo Servers that don't acceptuploads.We also print a warning when uploads are enabled encouraging upgrades.Part of GHSA-2p3c-p3qw-69r4",1

"Merge pull request from GHSA-h6q6-9hqw-rwfv * fix!: Preserve quotes in DOCTYPE declarationSince the only purpose of parsing the DOCTYPE is to be able to restore it when serializing,we decided that it would be best to leave the parsed publicId and systemId as is,including any quotes.BREAKING CHANGE: If somebody relies on the actual unquoted values of those ids,they will need to take care of either single or double quotes and the right escaping.(Without this change this would not have been possible because the SAX parser alreadydropped the information about the quotes that have been used in the source.)https://www.w3.org/TR/2006/REC-xml11-20060816/#dtdhttps://www.w3.org/TR/2006/REC-xml11-20060816/#IDAX1KS (External Entity Declaration)Co-authored-by: Christian Bewernitz <coder@karfau.de>Co-authored-by: Chris Brody <chris.brody+brodybits@gmail.com>* feat(security): Improve error reporting; throw on duplicate attributeBREAKING CHANGE: It is currently not clear how to consistently deal with duplicate attributes,so it is also safer for our users to fail when detecting them.It is possible to configure the `DOMParser.errorHandler` before parsing, to handle those errors differently.To accomplish this and also be able to verify it in tests we needed to:- create a new `Error` type `ParseError` and export it- Throw `ParseError` from `errorHandler.fatalError` and prevent those from being caught in `XMLReader`.- export `DOMHandler` constructor as `__DOMHandler`Co-authored-by: Christian Bewernitz <coder@karfau.de>Co-authored-by: Chris Brody <chris.brody+brodybits@gmail.com>Co-authored-by: Christian Bewernitz <coder@karfau.de>",1

"[TASK] Migrate JavaScript unit test from karma to @web/test-runnerThe karma unit testing framework has been deprecated andsuggests to use modern alternatives instead.We use one of the recommended alternatives named @web/test-runnerwhich is toolset by the modern-web.dev and open-wc.org initiatives.It is based on mocha and es-dev-server, which allows to run ourJavaScript modules natively in the browser(without having to bundle them via rollup).Note that compiled test files have been removed from thesource tree, since we configure es-dev-server to transpilethem on demand, allowing error output from tests to beusing original line numbers and unmangled identifiers.The tests are executed in chrome by default (locally and CI).They can be executed via:  # Run once  npm run test  # Run tests whenever files change  npm run watch:build  npm run watch:test  # Open browser with devtools and debug mode activated  MODE=dev npm run watch:test -- --debugConfiguration is prepared to run in other browsers via playwright.Example:  # https://playwright.dev/docs/browsers#install-system-dependencies  npx playwright install --with-deps  BROWSERS=chrome,chromium,firefox,webkit npm run testCommands executed:  npm remove \    karma \    karma-chrome-launcher \    karma-coverage \    karma-jasmine \    karma-junit-reporter \    karma-rollup-preprocessor \    jasmine-core \    @types/jasmine  npm install --save-dev \    @web/test-runner \    @web/test-runner-playwright \    @web/dev-server-import-maps \    @web/dev-server-esbuild \    @open-wc/testing \    sinon  git rm -rf \    typo3/sysext/core/Tests/JavaScript \    typo3/sysext/backend/Tests/JavaScript  npm run buildResolves: #101960Releases: main, 12.4Change-Id: Ia2fa94a9f6d66664d9fce72e7443aaeb12e0ca08Reviewed-on: https://review.typo3.org/c/Packages/TYPO3.CMS/+/81040Tested-by: Andreas Fernandez <a.fernandez@scripting-base.de>Tested-by: Benjamin Franzke <ben@bnf.dev>Reviewed-by: Benni Mack <benni@typo3.org>Reviewed-by: Benjamin Franzke <ben@bnf.dev>Tested-by: Benni Mack <benni@typo3.org>Tested-by: core-ci <typo3@b13.com>Reviewed-by: Andreas Fernandez <a.fernandez@scripting-base.de>",0

"[MERGE #6242 @boingoing] Fix environment calculation for symbol captured in the param scopeMerge pull request #6242 from boingoing:23102586Consider this repro:```javascriptfunction test0() {  var k;  function foo(a = function() { +k; }) {      a();      function bar() { a }  };  eval('')  foo();}test0();```We're hitting a miscalculation of the environment index when we're attempting to look up the scope for symbol 'k'. In particular, the miscalculation occurs in ByteCodeGenerator::FindScopeForSym. In this function, we walk up the scope chain starting from the body scope of the anonymous function declared in the param scope of foo. Each scope we walk to for a function other than the anonymous function which requires instantiation will increment the environment index. The enclosing scope for the anonymous function body scope is the param scope of foo and the body scope of foo is not in the restored scope chain. When we walk to the param scope for foo, it does not have the must instantiate flag set so we (incorrectly) do not increment the environment index. Back when the body scope for foo was incorrectly enclosing the body scope of the anonymous function, we correctly calculated the environment index because the body scope for foo has the must instantiate flag set. Now that param scope for foo is in the scope chain instead of body scope, we need to mark the param scope as must instantiate so this lookup is correct.",1

"[1.11>master] [MERGE #6447 @rajeshpeter] ChakraCore Servicing Update for 2020.05BMerge pull request #6447 from rajeshpeter:servicing/2005**Changes to address the following issues:****[CVE-2020-1037]**Ensure JIT bails out when there is an object marked as temporary during an implicit call, to prevent objects stored on the stack to be used outside of the function. This is done by preventing removal of the Bailout instruction for that case during the DeadStore pass of GlobOpt.**[CVE-2020-1065]**A previous MSRC fix removes the body scope of an enclosing function when a nested function is declared in the param scope of that enclosing function. This an result in us calculating incorrect envIndex for any symbols captured from enclosing scopes if this skipped body scope appears in the frameDisplay being passed to the nested function. This fix addresses the issue by marking the parameter scope also as mustInstantiate = true so we end up computing the correct envIndex. This problem and the fix only triggers when the enclosing function's param and body scopes are merged so the param and body scopes will never appear together in the scope stack and as such will not mess up the envIndex.",1

"Fix bug in decoding residuals A partition order could occur, such that the block size was not amultiple of 2^order. Computation of the number of samples per partitiondid not account for this case, rounding down due to the bit shift. Thismeant that we would not fill the entire decode buffer.Claxon does not zero the decode buffer because it is (should be)overwritten anyway, and in the case of a format error, where the buffermight be only partially full, the buffer is not exposed again.Furthermore, the way decoding works in most places, is that we fill theentire buffer, just by looping to fill it. If the input bitstream doesnot contain enough data to fill the buffer, then that's a format error.In a few places though, we need to slice up the buffer before decodinginto it: for decoding individual channels, and also for decodingresiduals, which are split into partitions.This particular format error was especially nasty because it did notcause a format error down the line. Instead, it caused the buffer to besliced in a way where the slices together did not cover the entirebuffer, and so parts of uninitialized memory could remain in the buffer.Thanks a lot to Sergey ""Shnatsel"" Davidoff for reporting this bug,together with elaborate steps to reproduce that allowed me to pinpointthe cause quickly.",1

"Merge pull request from GHSA-88xq-w8cq-xfg7 This commit fixes the drop of an uninitialized `VMExternRef` for an `externref`global in an instance that failed to be allocated by the pooling instanceallocator.The following engine configuration (via `Config`) is required to be impacted bythis bug:* support for the reference types proposal must be enabled (this is the  default for `Config`).* a pooling allocation strategy must be configured via  `Config::allocation_strategy`, which is not the default allocation strategy.A module must be instantiated with the following characteristics:* The module defines at least one table or memory.* The module defines at least one `externref` global.During instantiation, one of the following must occur to cause theinstantiation to fail:* a call to `mprotect` or `VirtualAlloc` fails (e.g. out-of-memory conditions).* a resource limiter was configured in the associated Store (via `Store::limiter`  or `Store::limiter_async`) and the limiter returns false from the initial call  to grow_memory or grow_table.This results in a partially-initialized instance being dropped and that attemptsto drop the uninitialized `VMExternRef` representing the defined `externref` global.The fix is to track whether or not the `VMContext` of the instance has been fullyinitialized and skip the dropping of globals if not.",1

"[MERGE #6253 @boingoing] Enable defer parse for class members including constructorsMerge pull request #6253 from boingoing:defer_parse_class_membersEnable defer parse for class members including constructorsWe have the ability to defer parse any function except for class members (which includes explicit class constructors). Class members are basically parsed in the same way as object literal methods so it isn't very hard to support defer parsing for them since we already support defer parsing for object literal methods.The main complication here is supporting the unusual text extents for class constructors. The class constructor function itself is what we will eventually bind to the name of the class. However, calling toString on the class name should print the text of the entire class. We also need to know the exact text extents for the constructor method in order to defer parse it. There's already a mechanism we use to adjust the beginning of the text extents for async methods so I've extended this to support adjusting the length of the extents as well. We used to keep track of an extra uint tacked-on to FunctionBody but I moved this into a struct of two uints stored in the AuxPtr array instead. This struct is only allocated for objects with unusual text extents.Besides the text extents work, the remainder is mostly just bookkeeping various flags to let us know we're parsing a class constructor, derived constructor, class member, etc.",0
"Add SM 9.0 / Remove SM 7.5 from TF buildsWith the recent CUDA update we gained support for SM 9.0 compute capabilities (Hopper-based GPUs),but so far we didn't enabled this by default in the nightly builds.To keep file sizes in check we remove the build for SM 7.5. User's of theTuring architecture (SM 7.5) will fall back to Volta (SM 7.0) which is compatible.The main difference between Turing and Volta are TensorCores which TF doesn't target from custom CUDA kernels, hence we don't expect any peformance disadvantagesfor Turing users.It also brings us in line with what JAX is doing.PiperOrigin-RevId: 576835080",0

The current implementation was copying `bailOutInfo->capturedValues->constantValues` on every pass over the yield instr. However, in a loop the yield instr is passed over twice, and each time entries are moved from `bailOutInfo->capturedValues` into `bailOutInfo->usedCapturedValues`. On the second pass over the instr, the current implementation is overwriting the constant values list with an empty list.With this change, the constant values are transferred to the bailin instr directly in the code that processes bailout constant values and copy prop syms.",1

"MDL-79254 quiz_statistics: Convert recalculate task to ad-hocPreviously, quiz statistics processing happened on a scheduled task.This task looked for all quizzes with completed attempts, thendetermined if those quizzes had a statistics calculation that's newerthan the most recent attempt, then ran the statistics calculation ifneeded. It was hard coded to stop processing after 1 hour.The queries involved in determining which quizzes needed processingweren't terribly efficient, and combined with the 1 hour limit this madethe statistics unusable on large sites, where they are the most useful.This converts the scheduled task to an ad-hoc task, and uses an eventobserver for mod_quiz\event\attempt_submitted to queue a task whenit is needed. This removes the need for a query to work out what needsprocessing, and allows the task processing to be scaled up as needed.",0

Rewrote native Array.prototype.sort implementation in JavascriptArray.cpp to be stable using an Insertion sort for short arrays and merge sort for longer arrays.3. Incorporated recent spec changes including copying the array to a ""List"" before sorting.4. Following the defunct previous native implementation, an Array Sort without a compare method converts the array into structs of string & value pairs to optimise the use of the string comparison the spec requires.5. To avoid duplicating code, updated the TypedArray.prototype.sort to use the same sort implementation, this required defining CompareVarsInfo struct in the JavascriptArray.h header so it's accessible from TypedArray.cpp, also a helper method TypedArraySort is implemented within JavascriptArray.cpp in order to ensure instantiation of the correct versions of the template sort methods6. Various clean ups and corrects to the test suite to ensure elements of the new spec are being tested7. Also deleted some defunct comments and fixed an unrelated compile error affecting a new version of macOS",0

"[xla] improve control-flow handling in dynamic padderThe purpose of this change is to improve handling of dynamic shapes in thepresence of control flow.  Before this change, the DynamicPadder would alwayschoose to insert a PadToStatic op after Parameter and Infeed ops when theiroutput is used by a control flow op (While and Conditional).  This isundesirable in cases where the ops inside the control flow can directly consumethe dynamic shape withut requiring PadToStatic, since (among other reasons) wedo not want to call SliceToDynamic before calling these ops.This required significant changes to DynamicPadder and DynamicDimensionInference:- Instead of blindly inserting PadToStatic when control flow is present, we now  use HloDataflowAnalysis to find the uses of a dynamic Parameter/Infeed.  If none of  the uses require PadToStatic, we do not insert it.- An awkward case exists where a dynamic input to a While loop body is not used  in a way that requires PadToStatic, but the output of the while loop *does*  require PadToStatic.  (For example, the input could be dead while the output  was produced by an Infeed followed by some elementwise operation.)  In these  cases we should insert PadToStatic, to ensure the dynamic size is always  available even when the while loop condition is always false.- To handle the above, we must run DynamicDimensionInference on while loop  bodies before running it on the computation that contains the While op. This  ensures that the dynamic sizes of the while body's outputs are inferred and we  are sure that the PadToStatic is required.- Since we are now potentially running DynamicDimensionInference on computations  more than once, we must be sure that second and later runs do not produce  conflicting inferences.  This is achieved by tracking whether the dynamic  sizes have been already inferred for an op in the output shape of the op;  i.e. when the sizes are inferred we clear the dynamic dimensions from the op's  output shape.  We avoid running inferences on ops that output static shapes,  and postpone inference if the dynamic sizes of operands have not been  inferred.The changes described above required that tf2xla's dynamic shape handling betightened up.  The DynamicPadder changes described above require that dynamicdimensions are always semantically correct, and tf2xla/XlaBuilder did not alwaysproduce correct dynamic dimensions.- Do not generate broadcasts where non-broadcast dimensions are dynamic  (i.e. where the broadcast introduces new dynamic dimensions that were not  present in the operand).  These broadcasts don't make sense because there is  no operand to provide the size of the new dynamic dimension.  For similar  reasons, iota should never produce dynamic dimensions.- Change tf2xla's handling of binary ops to explicitly handle cases where an  input dimension size is <=1.  This is a somewhat weird case but is necessary  to support some TF graphs.  XLA only broadcasts degenerate dimensions of size  1, so binary TF ops now explicitly broadcast these dimensions when necessary.- Correctly propagate dynamic dimensions in TPU image resize kernels.PiperOrigin-RevId: 575334042",1

"Fix environment calculation for symbol captured in the param scopeConsider this repro:```javascriptfunction test0() {  var k;  function foo(a = function() { +k; }) {      a();      function bar() { a }  };  eval('')  foo();}test0();```We're hitting a miscalculation of the environment index when we're attempting to look up the scope for symbol 'k'. In particular, the miscalculation occurs in ByteCodeGenerator::FindScopeForSym. In this function, we walk up the scope chain starting from the body scope of the anonymous function declared in the param scope of foo. Each scope we walk to for a function other than the anonymous function which requires instantiation will increment the environment index. The enclosing scope for the anonymous function body scope is the param scope of foo and the body scope of foo is not in the restored scope chain. When we walk to the param scope for foo, it does not have the must instantiate flag set so we (incorrectly) do not increment the environment index. Back when the body scope for foo was incorrectly enclosing the body scope of the anonymous function, we correctly calculated the environment index because the body scope for foo has the must instantiate flag set. Now that param scope for foo is in the scope chain instead of body scope, we need to mark the param scope as must instantiate so this lookup is correct.",0

"Remove ReDoS vulnerability in the Sec-WebSocket-Extensions header parser There is a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerability inthe parser we use to process the `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` header. Itcan be exploited by sending an opening WebSocket handshake to a servercontaining a header of the form:    Sec-WebSocket-Extensions: a;b=""\c\c\c\c\c\c\c\c\c\c ...i.e. a header containing an unclosed string parameter value whosecontent is a repeating two-byte sequence of a backslash and some othercharacter. The parser takes exponential time to reject this header asinvalid, and this can be used to exhaust the server's capacity toprocess requests.This vulnerability has been assigned the identifier CVE-2020-7663.We believe this flaw stems from the grammar specified for this header.[RFC 6455][1] defines the grammar for the header as:    Sec-WebSocket-Extensions = extension-list    extension-list    = 1#extension    extension         = extension-token *( "";"" extension-param )    extension-token   = registered-token    registered-token  = token    extension-param   = token [ ""="" (token | quoted-string) ]It refers to [RFC 2616][2] for the definitions of `token` and`quoted-string`, which are:    token          = 1*<any CHAR except CTLs or separators>    separators     = ""("" | "")"" | ""<"" | "">"" | ""@""                   | "","" | "";"" | "":"" | ""\"" | <"">                   | ""/"" | ""["" | ""]"" | ""?"" | ""=""                   | ""{"" | ""}"" | SP | HT    quoted-string  = ( <""> *(qdtext | quoted-pair ) <""> )    qdtext         = <any TEXT except <"">>    quoted-pair    = ""\"" CHARThese rely on the `CHAR`, `CTL` and `TEXT` grammars, which are:    CHAR           = <any US-ASCII character (octets 0 - 127)>    CTL            = <any US-ASCII control character (octets 0 - 31) and DEL (127)>    TEXT           = <any OCTET except CTLs, but including LWS>Other relevant definitions to support these:    OCTET          = <any 8-bit sequence of data>    LWS            = [CRLF] 1*( SP | HT )    CRLF           = CR LF    HT             = <US-ASCII HT, horizontal-tab (9)>    LF             = <US-ASCII LF, linefeed (10)>    CR             = <US-ASCII CR, carriage return (13)>    SP             = <US-ASCII SP, space (32)>To expand some of these terms out and write them as regular expressions:    OCTET         = [\x00-\xFF]    CHAR          = [\x00-\x7F]    TEXT          = [\t \x21-\x7E\x80-\xFF]The allowable bytes for `token` are [\x00-\x7F], except [\x00-\x1F\x7F](leaving [\x20-\x7E]) and `separators`, which leaves the following setof allowed chars:    ! # $ % & ' * + - . ^ _ ` | ~ [0-9] [A-Z] [a-z]`quoted-string` contains a repeated pattern of either `qdtext` or`quoted-pair`. `qdtext` is any `TEXT` byte except <"">, and the <"">character is ASCII 34, or 0x22. The <!> character is 0x21. So `qdtext`can be written either positively as:    qdtext        = [\t !\x23-\x7E\x80-\xFF]or negatively, as:    qdtext        = [^\x00-\x08\x0A-\x1F\x7F""]We use the negative definition here. The other alternative in the`quoted-string` pattern is:    quoted-pair   = \\[\x00-\x7F]The problem is that the set of bytes matched by `qdtext` includes <\>,and intersects with the second element of `quoted-pair`. That means thesequence \c can be matched as either two `qdtext` bytes, or as a single`quoted-pair`. When the regex engine fails to find a trailing <""> toclose the string, it back-tracks and tries every alternate parse for thestring, which doubles with each pair of bytes in the input.To fix the ReDoS flaw we need to rewrite the repeating pattern so thatnone of its alternate branches can match the same text. For example, wecould try dividing the set of bytes [\x00-\xFF] into those that must notfollow a <\>, those that may follow a <\>, and those that must bepreceded by <\>, and thereby construct a pattern of the form:    (A|\?B|\C)*where A, B and C have no characters in common. In our case the threebranch patterns would be:    A   =   qdtext - CHAR   =   [\x80-\xFF]    B   =   qdtext & CHAR   =   [\t !\x23-\x7E]    C   =   CHAR - qdtext   =   [\x00-\x08\x0A-\x1F\x7F""]These sets do not intersect, and notice <""> appears in set C so must bepreceded by <\>. But we still have a problem: <\> (0x5C) and all thealphabetic characters are in set B, so the pattern \?B can match allthese:    c    \    \cSo the sequence \c\c\c... still produces exponential back-tracking. Italso fails to parse input like this correctly:    Sec-WebSocket-Extensions: a; b=""c\"", d""Because the grammar allows a single backslash to appear by itself, thisis arguably a syntax error where the parameter `b` has value `c\` andthen a new extension `d` begins with a <""> appearing where it shouldnot.So the core problem is with the grammar itself: `qdtext` matches asingle backslash <\>, and `quoted-pair` matches a pair <\\>. So given asequence of backslashes there's no canonical parse and the grammar isambiguous.[RFC 7230][3] remedies this problem and makes the grammar clearer.First, it defines `token` explicitly rather than implicitly:    token          = 1*tchar    tchar          = ""!"" / ""#"" / ""$"" / ""%"" / ""&"" / ""'"" / ""*""                   / ""+"" / ""-"" / ""."" / ""^"" / ""_"" / ""`"" / ""|"" / ""~""                   / DIGIT / ALPHAAnd second, it defines `quoted-string` so that backslashes cannot appearon their own:     quoted-string  = DQUOTE *( qdtext / quoted-pair ) DQUOTE     qdtext         = HTAB / SP /%x21 / %x23-5B / %x5D-7E / obs-text     obs-text       = %x80-FF     quoted-pair    = ""\"" ( HTAB / SP / VCHAR / obs-text )where VCHAR is any printing ASCII character 0x21-0x7E. Notice `qdtext`is just our previous definition but with 5C excluded, so it cannotaccept a single backslash.This commit makes this modification to our matching patterns, andthereby removes the ReDoS vector. Technically this means it does notmatch the grammar of RFC 6455, but we expect this to have little or nopractical impact, especially since the one main protocol extension,`permessage-deflate` ([RFC 7692][4]), does not have any string-valuedparameters.[1]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-9.1[2]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-2.2[3]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2.6[4]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7692",1

"Fix command injection vulnerability @ronomon/opened was vulnerable to a command injection vulnerabilitythat would allow a remote attacker to execute commands on the system ifthe library was used with untrusted input.The root cause of the problem was line 87 in index.js which tookpotential untrusted input as part of a string executed as a commandby `child_process.exec()`. While the arguments were escaped by@ronomon/opened, an attacker could still bypass this sanitizationbecause `child_process.exec()` will also interpret the string as ashell command.This fix moves to `execFile` to spawn the binary with separatearguments that will not also be interpreted as shell commands.Thanks to Fábio Freitas, a security analyst at Checkmarx's CxSCA group,for discovering and disclosing the vulnerability, providing clear stepsto reproduce and suggestions for mitigation.",1

"Fix signature verification issues. **SECURITY**: Three RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signature verification issues werereported by Moosa Yahyazadeh (moosa-yahyazadeh@uiowa.edu):- Leniency in checking `digestAlgorithm` structure can lead to signature  forgery.  - The code is lenient in checking the digest algorithm structure. This can    allow a crafted structure that steals padding bytes and uses unchecked    portion of the PKCS#1 encoded message to forge a signature when a low    public exponent is being used.- Failing to check tailing garbage bytes can lead to signature forgery.  - The code does not check for tailing garbage bytes after decoding a    `DigestInfo` ASN.1 structure. This can allow padding bytes to be removed    and garbage data added to forge a signature when a low public exponent is    being used.- Leniency in checking type octet.  - `DigestInfo` is not properly checked for proper ASN.1 structure. This can    lead to successful verification with signatures that contain invalid    structures but a valid digest.For more information, please see ""Bleichenbacher's RSA signature forgery basedon implementation error"" by Hal Finney:https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/openpgp/5rnE9ZRN1AokBVj3VqblGlP63QE/Fixed with the following:- [asn1] `fromDer` is now more strict and will default to ensuring all  input bytes are parsed or throw an error. A new option `parseAllBytes`  can disable this behavior.  - **NOTE**: The previous behavior is being changed since it can lead    to security issues with crafted inputs. It is possible that code    doing custom DER parsing may need to adapt to this new behavior and    optional flag.- [rsa] Add and use a validator to check for proper structure of parsed  ASN.1 `RSASSA-PKCS-v1_5` `DigestInfo` data. Additionally check that  the hash algorithm identifier is a known value. An invalid  `DigestInfo` or algorithm identifier will now cause an error to be  thrown.- [oid] Added `1.2.840.113549.2.2` / `md2` for hash algorithm checking.- [tests] Tests were added for all of the reported issues. A private  verify option was added to assist in checking multiple possible  failures in the test data.",1

"Make res.set() chainable This fixes a bug which causes Sails to become unresponsive (or evencrash) when a message portraying an OPTIONS request for an undefinedroute is emitted over the socket.io REST interface.Steps to reproduce:In a terminal:$ sails new killme$ cd killme$ sails liftIn a browser's JS console (on localhost:1337):> io.socket.request({method: 'options', url: '/anUndefinedRoute'});The issue is a result of using Express' router with a constructedresponse object which does not meet expectations set by Express.For OPTIONS requests, Express' router enters a code path where send()is called on the result of res.set() (see line 188 of lib/router/index.jsin Express v3.x). When/if set() is not chainable, we trigger aninfinite loop which brings Sails down.The patch could have undesirable side effects if the value previouslyreturned from set() is used somewhere. I could not find any suchoccurences in this repository. In any case, this should be considereda quick-fix, since ideally, we should not use a third-party router atall, to avoid similar issues (in other words, fix the TODO on line 46in router/index.js).The issue happens with Express v3.x, possibly not an issue in laterversions where the relevant code seems to have been subjected tomajor refactorizations.",1

"2.92.0: * Bug fix: an open redirect vulnerability has been fixed. It was possible to convince Apostrophe to redirect to a third-party website by appending an escaped URL with a trailing slash added at the end. Apostrophe's trailing-slash remover would then cause a redirect to the un-escaped version of the slug part of the URL. The fix removes all multiple-slash sequences from the slug part of the URL. Thanks to Bharath for reporting this issue.* Bug fix: attempting to save a doc with a `required` `array` field without ever opening the array editor formerly caused strange behavior. You now get a standard indication that the field is required.* Feature: the method that supplies the choices for a dynamic `select` element may be a simple synchronous function, if desired. Formerly returning a promise (or using an async function) was mandatory.* Feature: `apos.utils.post` will now accept a `FormData` object as the `data` prameter. In this situation JSON encoding is not used. This may be used to easily submit file uploads with Apostrophe's CSRF protection and is supported at least back to IE11.",1

"[MERGE #6232 @pleath] Change the way the JIT renumbers byte code tempsMerge pull request #6232 from pleath:no-unusedThe JIT currently does not renumber byte code temps in boolean-expression-like cases that have the form:Brm $L1Rm = op1 ...Br $L2$L1:Rm = op2 ...$L2:... = op3 RmThis is hard to maintain, because it relies on conscientious use of the Unused op in byte code where a def of a register is not followed by a use, but we still want to renumber the register at the next use. Failure to emit Unused results in silent failure to renumber, which in turn results in suboptimal jitted code. This change deletes Unused, adds several byte codes of the form op_ReuseLoc, and causes the JIT to renumber lifetimes at each def unless the op_ReuseLoc is emitted. Failure to emit op_ReuseLoc will produce incorrect code that is detectable by the JIT (i.e., temps not defined on all paths). The biggest change is to the family of byte code patterns we emit to handle dynamic binding cases. These are restructured to limit the kinds of op_ReuseLoc ops we need to define.",1

"Merge pull request from GHSA-j2x6-9323-fp7h This commit addresses two issues in validating returndata, both relatedto the inferred type of the external call return.First, it addresses an issue with interfaces imported from JSON. TheJSON_ABI encoding type was added in 0.3.0 as part of the callingconvention refactor to mimic the old code's behavior when the signatureof a function had `is_from_json` toggled to True. However, bothimplementations were a workaround for the fact that inFunctionSignatures from JSON with Bytes return types, length is set to 1as a hack to ensure they always typecheck - almost always resulting in aruntime revert.This commit removes the JSON_ABI encoding type, so that dynamicreturndata from an interface defined with .json ABI file cannot resultin a buffer overrun(!). To avoid the issue with always runtimereverting, codegen uses the uses the inferred ContractFunction type ofthe Call.func member (which is both more accurate than the inferred typeof the Call expression, and the return type on the FunctionSignature!)to calculate the length of the external Bytes array.Second, this commit addresses an issue with validating call returns incomplex expressions. In the following examples, the type of the callreturn is either inferred incorrectly or it takes a path through codegenwhich avoids generating runtime clamps:```interface Foo:    def returns_int128() -> int128: view    def returns_Bytes3() -> Bytes[3]: viewfoo: Foo...x: uint256 = convert(self.foo.returns_int128(), uint256)y: Bytes[32] = concat(self.foo.returns_Bytes3(), b"""")```To address this issue, if the type of returndata needs validation, thiscommit decodes the returndata ""strictly"" into a newly allocated bufferat the time of the call, to avoid unvalidated data accidentally gettinginto the runtime. This does result in extra memory traffic which is aperformance hit, but the performance issue can be addressed at a laterdate with a zero-copy buffering scheme (parent Expr allocates thebuffer).Additional minor fixes and cleanup:- fix compiler panic in new_type_to_old_type for Tuples- remove `_should_decode` helper function as it duplicates `needs_clamp`- minor optimization in returndatasize check - assert ge uses one fewer  instruction than assert gt.",1

internal scope contains unofficial and undocumented fields (prefixed with underscore `_`) which are used internally by Parse Server; you may want to manipulate these fields for out-of-band changes such as data migration or correction tasks; changes within the internal scope of Parse Server may happen at any time without notice or changelog entry, it is therefore recommended to look at the source code of Parse Server to understand the effects of manipulating internal fields before using the key; it is discouraged to use the `maintenanceKey` for routine operations in a production environment; see [access scopes](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server#access-scopes) ([#8212](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/issues/8212))

The Docker image does not contain the git dependency anymore; if you have been using git as a transitive dependency it now needs to be explicitly installed in your Docker file, for example with `RUN apk --no-cache add git` (#8359) ([40810b4](40810b4))* Fields in the internal scope of Parse Server (prefixed with underscore `_`) are only returned using the new `maintenanceKey`; previously the `masterKey` allowed reading of internal fields; see [access scopes](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server#access-scopes) for a comparison of the keys' access permissions (#8212) ([f3bcc93](f3bcc93))* The method `ParseServer.verifyServerUrl` now returns a promise instead of a callback. ([ffa4974](ffa4974))* The MongoDB aggregation pipeline requires native MongoDB syntax instead of the custom Parse Server syntax; for example pipeline stage names require a leading dollar sign like `$match` and the MongoDB document ID is referenced using `_id` instead of `objectId` (#8362) ([d0d30c4](d0d30c4))* The mechanism to determine the client IP address has been rewritten; to correctly determine the IP address it is now required to set the Parse Server option `trustProxy` accordingly if Parse Server runs behind a proxy server, see the express framework's [trust proxy](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/behind-proxies.html) setting (#8372) ([892040d](892040d))* The Node Package Manager lock file `package-lock.json` is upgraded to version 2; while it is backwards with version 1 for the npm installer, consider this if you run any non-npm analysis tools that use the lock file (#8285) ([ee72467](ee72467))* This release introduces the asynchronous initialization of Parse Server to prevent mounting Parse Server before being ready to receive request; it changes how Parse Server is imported, initialized and started; it also removes the callback `serverStartComplete`; see the [Parse Server 6 migration guide](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/blob/alpha/6.0.0.md) for more details (#8232) ([99fcf45](99fcf45))* Nested objects are now properly stored in the database using JSON serialization; previously, due to a bug only top-level objects were serialized, but nested objects were saved as raw JSON; for example, a nested `Date` object was saved as a JSON object like `{ ""__type"": ""Date"", ""iso"": ""2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"" }` instead of its serialized representation `2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z` (#8209) ([1412666](1412666))* The Parse Server option `enforcePrivateUsers` is set to `true` by default; in previous releases this option defaults to `false`; this change improves the default security configuration of Parse Server (#8283) ([ed499e3](ed499e3))* This release restricts the use of `masterKey` to localhost by default; if you are using Parse Dashboard on a different server to connect to Parse Server you need to add the IP address of the server that hosts Parse Dashboard to this option (#8281) ([6c16021](6c16021))* This release upgrades to Redis 4; if you are using the Redis cache adapter with Parse Server then this is a breaking change as the Redis client options have changed; see the [Redis migration guide](https://github.com/redis/node-redis/blob/redis%404.0.0/docs/v3-to-v4.md) for more details (#8293) ([7d622f0](7d622f0))* This release removes support for MongoDB 4.0; the new minimum supported MongoDB version is 4.2. which also removes support for the deprecated MongoDB MMAPv1 storage engine ([37245f6](37245f6))* Throwing an error in Cloud Code Triggers `afterLogin`, `afterLogout` returns a rejected promise; in previous releases it crashed the server if you did not handle the error on the Node.js process level; consider adapting your code if your app currently handles these errors on the Node.js process level with `process.on('unhandledRejection', ...)` ([130d290](130d290))* Config option `directAccess` defaults to true; set this to `false` in environments where multiple Parse Server instances run behind a load balancer and Parse requests within the current Node.js environment should be routed via the load balancer and distributed as HTTP requests among all instances via the `serverURL`. ([f535ee6](f535ee6))* The convenience method for HTTP requests `Parse.Cloud.httpRequest` is removed; use your preferred 3rd party library for making HTTP requests ([2d79c08](2d79c08))* This release removes Node 12 and Node 17 support ([2546cc8](2546cc8))",1

"[BUGFIX] Fix race condition in module routerThe module components (like the iframe wrapper) arecreated asynchronously after their implementing module(e.g. <typo3-iframe-module>) is loaded.The router had a preparatory check that verifiedthat existing module elements are reused, but missedto verifiy whether the element has been created inparallel while the module components javascript modulewas loaded.

Fix for the array inline segment assert.This assert is happening due to false positive. The array's head segment is not allocated as inlined - but it was allocated on the page boundary.That makes this segement to just aligned with the array and we got the assert fired for wrong reason.We don't need to check the assert for the source array to be not inlined as in the above 'else' condition we allocated the dest segment ourselve in the same function.So I removed the part where we check the current array is not inlined.,0

"Fix wildcard check_origin vulnerability. Previously, our documentation points to a wilcard example of:    check_origin: [      ""//*.other.com""    ]Which should allow any subdomain of ""other.com"", but our comparisonfor `""//*.other.com""` would allow `api.any-other.com`, which wouldallow an attacker to register a domain with a custom prefix of a targetdomain and pass origin checks. This patch ensures the `String.ends_with?`check includes the subdomain dot prefix.Who is affected?Only those using a wildcard check origin are affected, and potentialexploits are limited to allowing unauthenticated channel connectionsfrom a bad host. Because LiveView adds its own csrf token to theconnection by default, LiveView applications with wildcard check originwould refuse connection under this scenario. Additionally, channelapplications utilizing token based authentication would require theattacker to also have a valid token to connection from a bad host.Phoenix channels does not allow access to cookies, so an attacker wouldalso not be able to pass their own cookies from a bad host.",1

"Remove ReDoS vulnerability in the Sec-WebSocket-Extensions header parser There is a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerability inthe parser we use to process the `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` header. Itcan be exploited by sending an opening WebSocket handshake to a servercontaining a header of the form:    Sec-WebSocket-Extensions: a;b=""\c\c\c\c\c\c\c\c\c\c ...i.e. a header containing an unclosed string parameter value whosecontent is a repeating two-byte sequence of a backslash and some othercharacter. The parser takes exponential time to reject this header asinvalid, and this can be used to exhaust the server's capacity toprocess requests.This vulnerability has been assigned the identifier CVE-2020-7662 andwas reported by Robert McLaughlin.We believe this flaw stems from the grammar specified for this header.[RFC 6455][1] defines the grammar for the header as:    Sec-WebSocket-Extensions = extension-list    extension-list    = 1#extension    extension         = extension-token *( "";"" extension-param )    extension-token   = registered-token    registered-token  = token    extension-param   = token [ ""="" (token | quoted-string) ]It refers to [RFC 2616][2] for the definitions of `token` and`quoted-string`, which are:    token          = 1*<any CHAR except CTLs or separators>    separators     = ""("" | "")"" | ""<"" | "">"" | ""@""                   | "","" | "";"" | "":"" | ""\"" | <"">                   | ""/"" | ""["" | ""]"" | ""?"" | ""=""                   | ""{"" | ""}"" | SP | HT    quoted-string  = ( <""> *(qdtext | quoted-pair ) <""> )    qdtext         = <any TEXT except <"">>    quoted-pair    = ""\"" CHARThese rely on the `CHAR`, `CTL` and `TEXT` grammars, which are:    CHAR           = <any US-ASCII character (octets 0 - 127)>    CTL            = <any US-ASCII control character (octets 0 - 31) and DEL (127)>    TEXT           = <any OCTET except CTLs, but including LWS>Other relevant definitions to support these:    OCTET          = <any 8-bit sequence of data>    LWS            = [CRLF] 1*( SP | HT )    CRLF           = CR LF    HT             = <US-ASCII HT, horizontal-tab (9)>    LF             = <US-ASCII LF, linefeed (10)>    CR             = <US-ASCII CR, carriage return (13)>    SP             = <US-ASCII SP, space (32)>To expand some of these terms out and write them as regular expressions:    OCTET         = [\x00-\xFF]    CHAR          = [\x00-\x7F]    TEXT          = [\t \x21-\x7E\x80-\xFF]The allowable bytes for `token` are [\x00-\x7F], except [\x00-\x1F\x7F](leaving [\x20-\x7E]) and `separators`, which leaves the following setof allowed chars:    ! # $ % & ' * + - . ^ _ ` | ~ [0-9] [A-Z] [a-z]`quoted-string` contains a repeated pattern of either `qdtext` or`quoted-pair`. `qdtext` is any `TEXT` byte except <"">, and the <"">character is ASCII 34, or 0x22. The <!> character is 0x21. So `qdtext`can be written either positively as:    qdtext        = [\t !\x23-\x7E\x80-\xFF]or negatively, as:    qdtext        = [^\x00-\x08\x0A-\x1F\x7F""]We use the negative definition here. The other alternative in the`quoted-string` pattern is:    quoted-pair   = \\[\x00-\x7F]The problem is that the set of bytes matched by `qdtext` includes <\>,and intersects with the second element of `quoted-pair`. That means thesequence \c can be matched as either two `qdtext` bytes, or as a single`quoted-pair`. When the regex engine fails to find a trailing <""> toclose the string, it back-tracks and tries every alternate parse for thestring, which doubles with each pair of bytes in the input.To fix the ReDoS flaw we need to rewrite the repeating pattern so thatnone of its alternate branches can match the same text. For example, wecould try dividing the set of bytes [\x00-\xFF] into those that must notfollow a <\>, those that may follow a <\>, and those that must bepreceded by <\>, and thereby construct a pattern of the form:    (A|\?B|\C)*where A, B and C have no characters in common. In our case the threebranch patterns would be:    A   =   qdtext - CHAR   =   [\x80-\xFF]    B   =   qdtext & CHAR   =   [\t !\x23-\x7E]    C   =   CHAR - qdtext   =   [\x00-\x08\x0A-\x1F\x7F""]These sets do not intersect, and notice <""> appears in set C so must bepreceded by <\>. But we still have a problem: <\> (0x5C) and all thealphabetic characters are in set B, so the pattern \?B can match allthese:    c    \    \cSo the sequence \c\c\c... still produces exponential back-tracking. Italso fails to parse input like this correctly:    Sec-WebSocket-Extensions: a; b=""c\"", d""Because the grammar allows a single backslash to appear by itself, thisis arguably a syntax error where the parameter `b` has value `c\` andthen a new extension `d` begins with a <""> appearing where it shouldnot.So the core problem is with the grammar itself: `qdtext` matches asingle backslash <\>, and `quoted-pair` matches a pair <\\>. So given asequence of backslashes there's no canonical parse and the grammar isambiguous.[RFC 7230][3] remedies this problem and makes the grammar clearer.First, it defines `token` explicitly rather than implicitly:    token          = 1*tchar    tchar          = ""!"" / ""#"" / ""$"" / ""%"" / ""&"" / ""'"" / ""*""                   / ""+"" / ""-"" / ""."" / ""^"" / ""_"" / ""`"" / ""|"" / ""~""                   / DIGIT / ALPHAAnd second, it defines `quoted-string` so that backslashes cannot appearon their own:     quoted-string  = DQUOTE *( qdtext / quoted-pair ) DQUOTE     qdtext         = HTAB / SP /%x21 / %x23-5B / %x5D-7E / obs-text     obs-text       = %x80-FF     quoted-pair    = ""\"" ( HTAB / SP / VCHAR / obs-text )where VCHAR is any printing ASCII character 0x21-0x7E. Notice `qdtext`is just our previous definition but with 5C excluded, so it cannotaccept a single backslash.This commit makes this modification to our matching patterns, andthereby removes the ReDoS vector. Technically this means it does notmatch the grammar of RFC 6455, but we expect this to have little or nopractical impact, especially since the one main protocol extension,`permessage-deflate` ([RFC 7692][4]), does not have any string-valuedparameters.[1]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-9.1[2]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-2.2[3]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2.6[4]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7692",1

"Merge pull request from GHSA-j2x6-9323-fp7h This commit addresses two issues in validating returndata, both relatedto the inferred type of the external call return.First, it addresses an issue with interfaces imported from JSON. TheJSON_ABI encoding type was added in 0.3.0 as part of the callingconvention refactor to mimic the old code's behavior when the signatureof a function had `is_from_json` toggled to True. However, bothimplementations were a workaround for the fact that inFunctionSignatures from JSON with Bytes return types, length is set to 1as a hack to ensure they always typecheck - almost always resulting in aruntime revert.This commit removes the JSON_ABI encoding type, so that dynamicreturndata from an interface defined with .json ABI file cannot resultin a buffer overrun(!). To avoid the issue with always runtimereverting, codegen uses the uses the inferred ContractFunction type ofthe Call.func member (which is both more accurate than the inferred typeof the Call expression, and the return type on the FunctionSignature!)to calculate the length of the external Bytes array.Second, this commit addresses an issue with validating call returns incomplex expressions. In the following examples, the type of the callreturn is either inferred incorrectly or it takes a path through codegenwhich avoids generating runtime clamps:```interface Foo:    def returns_int128() -> int128: view    def returns_Bytes3() -> Bytes[3]: viewfoo: Foo...x: uint256 = convert(self.foo.returns_int128(), uint256)y: Bytes[32] = concat(self.foo.returns_Bytes3(), b"""")```To address this issue, if the type of returndata needs validation, thiscommit decodes the returndata ""strictly"" into a newly allocated bufferat the time of the call, to avoid unvalidated data accidentally gettinginto the runtime. This does result in extra memory traffic which is aperformance hit, but the performance issue can be addressed at a laterdate with a zero-copy buffering scheme (parent Expr allocates thebuffer).Additional minor fixes and cleanup:- fix compiler panic in new_type_to_old_type for Tuples- remove `_should_decode` helper function as it duplicates `needs_clamp`- minor optimization in returndatasize check - assert ge uses one fewer  instruction than assert gt.",1

"Improve Halcyon SectionParser logic In addition to adding method signature typehints and general code tidying; this commit improves the ability of the SectionParser to handle extraneous section separators in appearing in settings, code, & markup content.With these changes; if extra separators are found in the markup section, instead of ignoring the extra sections they will be considered part of the markup section. Additionally, if extra sections are found in the markup section and there was previously only 1 or 2 sections total (markup only or settings and markup) the SectionParser::render() method will force there to be 3 sections in order to guarantee additional separators found in the markup section stay in the markup section.Another change to the SectionParser::render() method is that it will now throw an InvalidArgumentException if section separators are found in either the settings section or the code section as it is not currently possible to avoid accidentally parsing separators in those locations as if they were valid and intentional separators.This is somewhat related to octobercms/library@c393c5c although instead of just dropping all possible sections within markup and keeping the last one - this change implements more robust support for section separators appearing in places where they shouldn't.(cherry picked from commit 97c5da2)",1

"Handle exceptions in _repr_jpeg_ and _repr_png_In 10.0.0 a _repr_jpeg_ implementation was added to the Image object toenable the use of display_jpeg() in IPython environments. However, insome cases the implementation of this method could result in anexception being raised while trying to generate the jpeg data. The bestexample is if the image data is in an RGBA format as a result of theobject being created by opening a PNG file. In this case trying to savethe Image object as a jpeg will error because the jpeg format can'trepresent the transparency in the alpha channel. This results in anexception being raised in the IPython/Jupyter context when outputing theimage object. However, in cases like this IPython allows the reprmethods to return None to indicate there is no representation in thatformat available. [1] This commit updates the _repr_png_ and _repr_jpeg_methods to catch any exception that might be raised while trying togenerate the image data. If an exception is raised we treat that as notbeing able to generate image data in that format and return Noneinstead.Related to #7259[1] https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config/integrating.html#custom-methods",1

[CVE-2020-1065] A previous MSRC fix removes the body scope of an enclosing function when a nested function is declared in the param scope of that enclosing function. This an result in us calculating incorrect envIndex for any symbols captured from enclosing scopes if this skipped body scope appears in the frameDisplay being passed to the nested function. This fix addresses the issue by marking the parameter scope also as mustInstantiate = true so we end up computing the correct envIndex. This problem and the fix only triggers when the enclosing function's param and body scopes are merged so the param and body scopes will never appear together in the scope stack and as such will not mess up the envIndex.,1

"security: fix denial-of-service bug in compiler The regex compiler will happily attempt to compile '(?:){294967295}' bycompiling the empty sub-expression 294,967,295 times. Emptysub-expressions don't use any memory in the current implementation, sothis doesn't trigger the pre-existing machinery for stopping compilationearly if the regex object gets too big. The end result is that whilecompilation will eventually succeed, it takes a very long time to do so.In this commit, we fix this problem by adding a fake amount of memoryevery time we compile an empty sub-expression. It turns out we werealready tracking an additional amount of indirect heap usage via'extra_inst_bytes' in the compiler, so we just make it look likecompiling an empty sub-expression actually adds an additional 'Inst' tothe compiled regex object.This has the effect of causing the regex compiler to reject this sort ofregex in a reasonable amount of time by default.Many thanks to @VTCAKAVSMoACE for reporting this, providing the valuabletest cases and continuing to test this patch as it was developed.Fixes GHSA-m5pq-gvj9-9vr8",1

"Multiple fixes for go-getter v2 (#361) * Fix command injection in go-getter when passing params to hg cloneThe fix for this is to add -- to the arguments of each hg command,before any user-input. This indicates the end of optional arguments,only positional arguments are allowed.* Remove upwards path traversal in subdirectories, filenames* Prevent arbitrary file read, path traversal via subdirectory extractionNot opt-in or opt-out, just never allowed. Upwards path traversal is not a subdirectory.*Prevent arbitrary file write via `filename`Not opt-in or opt-out, just never allowed. Upwards path traversal is not a filename in a subdirectory.* Add Timeout option to HgGetter and GitGetter enforced with os/exec.CommandContext* Add DisableSymlinks option to getter requestThe fix for this is a new client request option, DisableSymlinks. When set to true, symlinks are disabled.This prevents the client, likely in combination with the GitGetter, from following a symlink when the subdirectoryselection from the checked out repo is a symlink.* Add custom symlink copy error* Add DisableSymlinks as client optionSetting DisableSymlinks per request works but must be set on all requestmade by a client. Adding it as a top-level client config option allowsfor setting DisableSymlinks for all client.Get requests.* Update get_http to address various get concerns* Add XTerraformGetLimit and XTerraformGetDisabled* Add Multiple new options to limit resource consumption:  DoNotCheckHeadFirst, HeadFirstTimeout, ReadTimeout, MaxBytes* Add getter client to context for reuse* Add setters/getters for storing configured getter.Client in a context* Update HttpGetter to use ClientFromContext when available; otherwise  use a limited client for supporting X-Terraform-Get request* Refactor HttpGetter function to make it clear when a configured  getter.Client is required* Add security section to README* Port changes from hashicorp/eastebry/timeout-for-gettersAdding timeout to s3Getter* Port changes from from hashicorp/add-missing-timeoutsAdd missing timeouts to `S3Getter` and `GCSGetter`* Remove windows test for FileGetter* Change to next-get imageCo-authored-by: Kent 'picat' Gruber <kent@hashicorp.com>Co-authored-by: Sylvia Moss <sylviamoss.m@gmail.com>",1

"[XLA:GPU] Don't test tsl::enable_tensor_float_32_execution(false) for dot anymoreThe `dot` instruction doesn't support the flag directly, just by checking the operand precisions.tf2xla/transforms/legalize_tf.cc sets them to highest if the TensorFloat-32 global variable is false.So now we also do that in the test.Hopefully b/280130359 will handle this in a nicer way.This came up when trying to enable xla_gpu_triton_gemm_any. When we do that, we'll switch a lot of dots over to the Triton codegen, which ignores the TensorFloat-32 global variable and only checks the operand precisions.PiperOrigin-RevId: 574452125",0

"Merge pull request from GHSA-8fp4-rp6c-5gcv Motivation:- We changed how `PathAndQuery` handles `%2F` (/) in 1.12.0 via #3855.  This change introduces an unexpected hole in its double-dot detection  logic.- Since we decided not to decode `%2F`, we should not decode it  whereever possible.Modifications:- Hardened the double-dot detection logic in `PathAndQuery`.- `Bytes.data` now always store the bytes in their decoded form. We keep  whether the byte has to be encoded in a separate `BitSet`.- Split `ArmeriaHttpUtil.decodePath()` into `decodePath()` and  `decodePathParam()`.  - We don't decode `%2F` in `decodePath()` but we do in    `decodePathParam()`.  - `RoutingResultBuilder.rawParam()` now uses `decodePathParam()`    because `decodePath()` doesn't decode `%2F` anymore.Result:- A path that contains double dots with `%2F`, such as  `/files/..%2Fsecrets.txt`, are now rejected correctly.",1

"fix: prevent path escape using drive-relative paths On Windows, a path like `c:foo` is not considered ""absolute"", but if thecwd it's being resolved against is on a different drive letter, then`resolve(cwd, path)` will not end up contained within `cwd`, even in theabsence of `..` portions.This change strips path roots from all paths prior to being resolvedagainst the extraction target folder, even if such paths are not""absolute"".Additionally, a path starting with a drive letter and then two dots,like `c:../`, would bypass the check for `..` path portions.  This isnow being checked properly.Finally, a defense in depth check is added, such that if theentry.absolute is outside of the extraction taret, and we are not inpreservePaths:true mode, a warning is raised on that entry, and it isskipped.  Currently, it is believed that this check is redundant, but itdid catch some oversights in development.",1

"Fix assembling mutable slice from const reference The pointer from which a mutable reference is created must haveprovenance for accessing the underlying elements of the struct and itsfields (a single array here) mutably. A pointer acquired byslice::as_ptr does not have that provenance, it only allows shared readaccess. The `slice::as_ptr` method says:> The caller must also ensure that the memory the pointer(non-transitively) points to is never written to (except inside anUnsafeCell) using this pointer or any pointer derived from it. If youneed to mutate the contents of the slice, use as_mut_ptr.This fails MIRI which checks for this assertion but I'm not aware ofmis-compilation resulting from it. In fact, consider:    pub fn as_ptr(slice: &mut [u8]) -> *const u8 {        slice.as_ptr()    }    pub fn as_mut_ptr(slice: &mut [u8]) -> *mut u8 {        slice.as_mut_ptr()    }<https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=28d3c19800236ae520441a22a6f99b19>Then llvm-IR in optimization will show that the functions are collapsedto a single one, hinting there is no semantic difference at that level.The difference in codegen is a readonly attribute on the slice::as_ptrargument but this is scoped to the particular function and argument, notthe pointer value itself:> On a function, this attribute indicates that the function does notwrite through any pointer arguments<https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html>Since the _outer_ function correctly takes a `&mut self` argument therestriction possibly no longer applies to our own method. Of course, astricter codegen of Rust's memory model might not be as kind and exploitthe MIR level UB here.",1

"[MERGE #6227 @zenparsing] Do not attempt to reuse Utf8SourceInfo if asmjs parse failsMerge pull request #6227 from zenparsing:asm-error-utf8source-2Fixes #6222When an asmjs parse fails, we reparse with asmjs disabled. However, currently we are reusing the same Utf8SourceInfo data, which contains a dictionary of FunctionBody objects. FunctionBody objects that were added in the first parse are still present in the source info dictionary. This causes an assert to fire in `DebugContext.cpp` because it expects there to be only one FunctionBody per source code function.This PR simply discards the old Utf8SourceInfo when an asmjs parse fails. The downside is that the source data has to be re-memcpyd. Another (more complex) solution would be to try to fully clear out the existing Utf8SourceInfo.",1

"rootfs: add mount destination validation Because the target of a mount is inside a container (which may be avolume that is shared with another container), there exists a racecondition where the target of the mount may change to a path containinga symlink after we have sanitised the path -- resulting in usinadvertently mounting the path outside of the container.This is not immediately useful because we are in a mount namespace withMS_SLAVE mount propagation applied to ""/"", so we cannot mount on top ofhost paths in the host namespace. However, if any subsequent mountpointsin the configuration use a subdirectory of that host path as a source,those subsequent mounts will use an attacker-controlled source path(resolved within the host rootfs) -- allowing the bind-mounting of ""/""into the container.While arguably configuration issues like this are not entirely withinrunc's threat model, within the context of Kubernetes (and possiblyother container managers that provide semi-arbitrary container creationprivileges to untrusted users) this is a legitimate issue. Since wecannot block mounting from the host into the container, we need to blockthe first stage of this attack (mounting onto a path outside thecontainer).The long-term plan to solve this would be to migrate to libpathrs, butas a stop-gap we implement libpathrs-like path verification throughreadlink(/proc/self/fd/$n) and then do mount operations through theprocfd once it's been verified to be inside the container. The targetcould move after we've checked it, but if it is inside the containerthen we can assume that it is safe for the same reason that libpathrsoperations would be safe.A slight wrinkle is the ""copyup"" functionality we provide for tmpfs,which is the only case where we want to do a mount on the hostfilesystem. To facilitate this, I split out the copy-up functionalityentirely so that the logic isn't interspersed with the regular tmpfslogic. In addition, all dependencies on m.Destination being overwrittenhave been removed since that pattern was just begging to be a source ofmore mount-target bugs (we do still have to modify m.Destination fortmpfs-copyup but we only do it temporarily).Fixes: CVE-2021-30465Reported-by: Etienne Champetier <champetier.etienne@gmail.com>Co-authored-by: Noah Meyerhans <nmeyerha@amazon.com>Reviewed-by: Samuel Karp <skarp@amazon.com>Reviewed-by: Kir Kolyshkin <kolyshkin@gmail.com> (@kolyshkin)Reviewed-by: Akihiro Suda <akihiro.suda.cz@hco.ntt.co.jp>Signed-off-by: Aleksa Sarai <cyphar@cyphar.com>",1

"language: reject excessively large Accept-Language strings The BCP 47 tag parser has quadratic time complexity due to inherentaspects of its design. Since the parser is, by design, exposed tountrusted user input, this can be leveraged to force a program toconsume significant time parsing Accept-Language headers.The parser cannot be easily rewritten to fix this behavior forvarious reasons. Instead the solution implemented in this CL is tolimit the total complexity of tags passed into ParseAcceptLanguageby limiting the number of dashes in the string to 1000. This shouldbe more than enough for the majority of real world use cases, wherethe number of tags being sent is likely to be in the single digits.Thanks to the OSS-Fuzz project for discovering this issue and to AdamKorczynski (ADA Logics) for writing the fuzz case and for reporting theissue.Fixes CVE-2022-32149Fixes golang/go#56152Change-Id: I7bda1d84cee2b945039c203f26869d58ee9374aeReviewed-on: https://team-review.git.corp.google.com/c/golang/go-private/+/1565112Reviewed-by: Damien Neil <dneil@google.com>Reviewed-by: Tatiana Bradley <tatianabradley@google.com>Reviewed-on: https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/text/+/442235TryBot-Result: Gopher Robot <gobot@golang.org>Auto-Submit: Roland Shoemaker <roland@golang.org>Run-TryBot: Roland Shoemaker <roland@golang.org>",1

"vuln-fix: Partial Path Traversal Vulnerability (#3080) This fixes a partial path traversal vulnerability.Replaces `dir.getCanonicalPath().startsWith(parent.getCanonicalPath())`, which is vulnerable to partial path traversal attacks, with the more secure `dir.getCanonicalFile().toPath().startsWith(parent.getCanonicalFile().toPath())`.To demonstrate this vulnerability, consider `""/usr/outnot"".startsWith(""/usr/out"")`.The check is bypassed although `/outnot` is not under the `/out` directory.It's important to understand that the terminating slash may be removed when using various `String` representations of the `File` object.For example, on Linux, `println(new File(""/var""))` will print `/var`, but `println(new File(""/var"", ""/"")` will print `/var/`;however, `println(new File(""/var"", ""/"").getCanonicalPath())` will print `/var`.Weakness: CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')Severity: MediumCVSSS: 6.1Detection: CodeQL & OpenRewrite (https://public.moderne.io/recipes/org.openrewrite.java.security.PartialPathTraversalVulnerability)Reported-by: Jonathan Leitschuh <Jonathan.Leitschuh@gmail.com>Signed-off-by: Jonathan Leitschuh <Jonathan.Leitschuh@gmail.com>Bug-tracker: JLLeitschuh/security-research#13Co-authored-by: Moderne <team@moderne.io>Co-authored-by: Moderne <team@moderne.io>",1

"[PATCH] Fix account takeover through CSRF attack This commit fixes an account takeover vulnerability when [Rails`protect_from_forgery`](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/RequestForgeryProtection/ClassMethods.html)method is both:- Executed whether as:  - A `before_action` callback (the default)  - A `prepend_before_action` (option `prepend: true`) before the  `:load_object` hook in `Spree::UsersController` (most likely order to  find).- Configured to use `:null_session` or `:reset_session`  strategies (`:null_session` is the default in case the no strategy is  given, but `rails --new` generated skeleton use `:exception`).Before this commit, the user was fetched in a `prepend_before_action`hook named `:load_object`. I.e., the user was loaded into an instancevariable before touching the session as a safety countermeasure. As therequest went forward, `#update` was called on that instance variable.The `:exception` strategy prevented the issue as, even if the user wasstill fetched, the request was aborted before the update phase. On theother hand, prepending `:protect_from_forgery` after the `:load_object`hook (not very likely, as `ApplicationController` is loaded inthe first place and it's the most likely place to have that definition)wiped the session before trying to fetch the user from it.We could have fixed the most likely issue by just using a`before_action` for `:load_object`, but it's safer not to rely on theorder of callbacks at all.",1

"[SECURITY] Introduce selective argument escaping Addresses three XSS vulnerabilities:* The ""then"" and ""else"" arguments of condition ViewHelpers  were not escaped. They are now escaped based on the  escapeChildren toggle of the ViewHelper, which is ON by  default in subclasses of AbstractConditionViewHelper.* Content arguments in ViewHelpers which disable  escapeOutput were not escaped, but values passed as  child node were escaped. Both cases are now treated  the same and escaping is based on escapeChildren state.* TagBased ViewHelpers allowed attribute names containing  HTML if passed in ""additionalAttributes"" which made XSS  possible by crafting array keys with HTML. Attribute names  are now subjected to the same escaping as attribute values.Also fixes a couple of undesirable behaviors as well, e.g. avoidsdouble escaping of output in some combinations of escapeOutput=trueand quoted arguments.",1

Instead, give byte code direct access to the prototype and constructor objects that are created when we initialize a class;- Create the right constructor type and type handler all at once instead of going through the stages of deferred type, simple type, path type, etc. There's no point in using a deferred type, since we know we'll immediately access the prototype field.

"Merge pull request from GHSA-8r69-3cvp-wxc3 In Apollo Server 2, plugins could not set HTTP response headers for HTTP-batchedoperations; the headers would simply not be written in that case.In Apollo Server 3, plugins can set HTTP response headers. They haveaccess to individual `response.http.headers` objects. In parallel, aftereach operation is processed, any response headers it sets are copied toa shared HTTP response header object. If multiple operations wrote thesame header, the one that finishes its processing last would ""win"",without any smart merging.Apollo Server 4 has the same overall behavior (though the details of theparticular objects in question have changed a bit).Notably, this means that the `cache-control` response header set by thecache control plugin had surprising behavior when combined withbatching. If you sent two operations in the same HTTP request withdifferent cache policies, the response header would be set based only onone of their policies, not on the combination of the policies. Thiscould lead to saving data that should not be cached in a cache, orsaving data that should only be cached per-user (`private`) in a morepublic cache.To fix this, we are making a change to the`GraphQLRequestContext.response` object as seen by plugins. Thisobject's `http` field is now shared across all operations in a batchedrequest, instead of being specific to the individual operation. Thismeans that any changes to headers (or HTTP status code) in pluginsprocessing one operation are immediately visible to plugins processinganother operation, and so they can properly merge header values.**This change is technically backwards-incompatible.** However, as thisis a relatively subtle change and as Apollo Server 4 is very new and itsadoption is relatively low (we haven't even formally announced AS4 onour blog yet), we feel comfortable making this change in a minor versioninstead of in a new major version.The cache control plugin is changed to merge `cache-control` responseheaders across multiple operations in a batched request. Note that ifthe `cache-control` header is ever set to any value that could not bewritten by the cache control plugin, the plugin will refuse to update itfurther so as not to lose information. (It is best to only set theheader from one place, and to disable the cache control plugin'sheader-writing feature with `calculateHttpHeaders: false` if you want towrite the header from elsewhere.)Additionally, a new `requestIsBatched: boolean` field is added to`GraphQLRequestContext`. This isn't read by anything in this PR.However, we will backport this field to Apollo Server 3, and use it todisable cache-control header writing for batched requests. (Backportingthe full solution to AS3 would be challenging because the relevant datastructures are more complex, and making a backwards-incompatible changeto an older version like AS3 is more problematic.)For more information, seeGHSA-8r69-3cvp-wxc3",1

"[MERGE #6464 @rajeshpeter] ChakraCore Servicing Update for 2020.06BMerge pull request #6464 from rajeshpeter:servicing/2006CVE-2020-1219]Js::PathTypeHandlerBase::SetPrototype should protect against the case where the instance's type is changed as a side-effect of calling newPrototype->GetInternalProperty. Intl.js should not refer directly to the global Intl property, as this may have been modified by the user in such a way that Intl initialization has side-effects. Created an Intl property on the interface object whose value is the built-in Intl object and refer to that in Intl.js instead.[CVE-2020-1073]Non-optimized StFld that may change the object's type may be undetected in the loop prepass, resulting in bad AdjustObjType downstream. If the dead store pass detects a final type that's live across a non-optimized StFld, mark the StFld to use a helper that will return true if the object's type is changed, and bail out if the helper returns true. Also ensures there is no type transition live across InitClassMember.",1

"Prevent unitialized memory access in `GraphConstructor::MakeEdge` The `MakeEdge` implementation assumes that there exists an output at `output_index` of `src` node and an input at `input_index` of `dst` node. However, if this is not the case this results in accessing data out of bounds. Because we are accessing an array that is a private member of a class and only in read only mode, this usually results only in unitialized memory access. However, it is reasonable to think that malicious users could manipulate these indexes to actually read data outside the class, thus resulting in information leakage and further exploits.PiperOrigin-RevId: 346343288Change-Id: I2127da27c2023d27f26efd39afa6c853385cab6f",1

The command being executed isable to read such information.This patch reduces the set of environment variables passed to theseintermediate processes, from all variables to the one which is used tocontrol the level of debug logging.

"[TASK] Add phpstan check for unneeded pseudo uncertain instanceof usageAn `instanceof Type` on `Type|null` is unneeded and is to be replaced bya null-check (or modern alternatives like optional chaning or the nullcoalescing operator) in order to avoid narrowing code branchesunnecessarily. We call them ""pseudo"" uncertain checks there is no needto express uncertainty regarding the type in a condition where nativetype declarations define a specific type *or* null:  It is `null` or `!null`.Definition of a pseudo uncertain instanceof check:  `$foo instanceof Bar` is fully equivalent to `$foo !== null`,    when `$foo` is defined (via native PHP types) to be `Bar|null`.   ⇒ `instanceof` expresses pseudo uncertainty regarding the type.From what we have seen in previous gerrit discussions, there were tworeasons why instanceof was preferred over null checks although beingunneeded:1) Cognitive load for an instanceof check is perceived to be lower in   contrast to negated null (not null) conditions2) Preparatory safe-guard against type of $foo being changed at sometime   later1) Cognitive load is a subjective term and the opinions actually differ   a lot. Some developers prefer narrowing instanceof conditions because   they claim the desired type for a certain code branch.   Some others say that's a clear signal for code that needs refactoring   and perceive a high cognitive load because they do not understand why   the type is unnecessarily checked if it can only be null or not null.   Lets call that: ""reverse cognitive load"".   That means, this argument basically boils down to   ""congitive load"" (for the good ""then"" case: inner code block) vs   ""reverse cognitive load"" (for the bad ""else"" case: outer code block)   ⇒ Due to being subjective ""cognitive load"" is not a good argument to     base a decision upon.2) The second argument is that an instanceof ensures a method that is to   be called actually exists and doesn't lead to an error – that is a   ""preparatory safe-guard"".   This is true and works, but doesn't ""answer"" the question,   what happens if the object is not an instance of the desired type   (but not null).   While preparatory safe-guards against the type of variable being   changed sometime later was probably a pretty good idea for code that   is not statically analyzed and had no native type declarations, but   such checks effectively preclude that the type must/should never   change (which might not be true!) and has no chance of actually   detecting when that case (type change/extension) ever happens.   All advantages offered by pseudo uncertain instanceof checks are   accomplished with static code analysis as well, but with the added   downside that an `instanceof` hardcodes our human static code   analysis result, instead of letting the static analyzer do the job.   To explain that:   If the type of the variable under test is actually widened (like a   union type, or change to a base class), it will never be   automatically detected that there is an instanceof condition that   restricts the type too narrowly. It will always be valid code from   static code analysis perspective.   In comparison to that, static analysis on null-checked variables will   report invalid method calls or assignments not allowed by the   (natively defined) types and will notify in case a type change   requires the code to be adapted.   We gain the advantage that the code will not be forgotten to   be updated to a new type.   That means !== null combined with static code analysis has the same   level of being a safeguard against the bad cases, while instanceof   silently transforms new ""good""-cases into bugs, where !== null is a   transparent and secure passthrough.   Actually to make an uncertain instanceof robust, an elseif branch   would be needed to be somehow notified about new good-cases without   silently ignoring them:   if ($foo instanceof Foo) {       …   } elseif ($foo !== null) {       throw new MustNeverHappenException(…);   }In other words an unneeded pseudo uncertain instanceof check isbasically like a switch construct without a default case.Just to be explicit: Of course, instanceof is fine to be usedwhen multiples types are to be expected and handled in different codebranches.That means pseudo uncertain instanceof usage instead of null-checks isan antipattern for the following reasons: * It narrow code branches for the sake of less cognitive load   * The cognitive load appears to be lower, but actually future-bad     cases are overseen and are never auto-detectable in future – while     null-checks will resolve to static analysis errors in case the     input type is *ever* widened (which uncertain `instanceof` checks     try to prepare for, but actually introduce future-bugs because of     missing `else` cases) * It embraces deep nesting instead of early returns via null-checks * It embraces conditions over newer and more elegant PHP techniques   like optional chaing * Tries to ""help"" the developer by explicitly anotating the   current type of the variable under test   ⇒ This is a clear sign of code smell, that needs to refactored into      smaller chunks and methods and type autocompletion/information      can be provided by IDEs when using proper types (which this change      is about) anyway * Has zero advantages over static code analysisResolves: #102140Releases: main, 12.4Change-Id: I10de41e9744a814c9e24255573b5a5eaf6fb8b0fReviewed-on: https://review.typo3.org/c/Packages/TYPO3.CMS/+/80859Tested-by: Andreas Kienast <a.fernandez@scripting-base.de>Tested-by: core-ci <typo3@b13.com>Tested-by: Oliver Hader <oliver.hader@typo3.org>Reviewed-by: Oliver Hader <oliver.hader@typo3.org>Tested-by: Benjamin Franzke <ben@bnf.dev>Reviewed-by: Benjamin Franzke <ben@bnf.dev>Reviewed-by: Andreas Kienast <a.fernandez@scripting-base.de>Reviewed-by: Nikita Hovratov <nikita.h@live.de>",1

"Protect `Spree::OrdersController#populate` against CSRF attacks SeeGHSA-h3fg-h5v3-vf8mfor all the details.Some time ago, all order actions were left out of CSRF protection (see95ea570). The reason given was that theauthentication token got stale after the second rendering because theproduct page is cached. That was limited to `#populate` incb79754 (see alsospree/spree#5601).However, those assumptions are not correct. Although the authenticitytoken changes at every request, that doesn't mean that the old ones areno longer valid. The variation comes from a one-time pad added to asession-dependant token (and meant to avoid timing attacks). However,before validation, that one-time pad is removed. That means the tokenremains valid as long as the session has not been reset. Think aboutsubmitting a form from one browser tab after opening another with thesame URL. Even if both tokens differ, the submission from the first tabwill still be valid. You can readhttps://medium.com/rubyinside/a-deep-dive-into-csrf-protection-in-rails-19fa0a42c0effor an in-deep understanding.The initial confusion could come because ofrails/rails#21948. Due to browser-side cache,a form can be re-rendered and sent without any attached request cookie.That will cause an authentication error, as the sent token won't matchwith the one in the session (none in this case). There's no perfectsolution for that, and all partial fixes should be seen at theapplication level. From our side, we must provide a safe default. For anexcellent survey of all the available options, take a look athttps://github.com/betagouv/demarches-simplifiees.fr/blob/5b4f7f9ae9eaf0ac94008b62f7047e4714626cf9/doc/adr-csrf-forgery.md.The information given in that link is third-party but it's veryrelevant here. For that reason we've copied it in the security advisory(see link above), but all the credit goes to @kemenaran.",1

"Merge pull request from GHSA-3p3g-vpw6-4w66 BREAKING CHANGE: This patch requires a new SQL Table which needs to be created using `hydra migrate sql`. No other breaking changes have been introduced by this patch.This patch introduces a blacklist for JTIs which prevents a potential replay of `private_key_jwt` JWTs when performing client authorization.## GHSA-3p3g-vpw6-4w66### ImpactWhen using client authentication method ""private_key_jwt"" [1], OpenId specification says the following about assertion `jti`:> A unique identifier for the token, which can be used to prevent reuse of the token. These tokens MUST only be used once, unless conditions for reuse were negotiated between the partiesHydra does not seem to check the uniqueness of this `jti` value. Here is me sending the same token request twice, hence with the same `jti` assertion, and getting two access tokens:```$ curl --insecure --location --request POST 'https://localhost/_/oauth2/token' \   --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \   --data-urlencode 'grant_type=client_credentials' \   --data-urlencode 'client_id=c001d00d-5ecc-beef-ca4e-b00b1e54a111' \   --data-urlencode 'scope=application openid' \   --data-urlencode 'client_assertion_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer' \   --data-urlencode 'client_assertion=eyJhb [...] jTw'{""access_token"":""zeG0NoqOtlACl8q5J6A-TIsNegQRRUzqLZaYrQtoBZQ.VR6iUcJQYp3u_j7pwvL7YtPqGhtyQe5OhnBE2KCp5pM"",""expires_in"":3599,""scope"":""application openid"",""token_type"":""bearer""}⏎            ~$ curl --insecure --location --request POST 'https://localhost/_/oauth2/token' \   --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \   --data-urlencode 'grant_type=client_credentials' \   --data-urlencode 'client_id=c001d00d-5ecc-beef-ca4e-b00b1e54a111' \   --data-urlencode 'scope=application openid' \   --data-urlencode 'client_assertion_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer' \   --data-urlencode 'client_assertion=eyJhb [...] jTw'{""access_token"":""wOYtgCLxLXlELORrwZlmeiqqMQ4kRzV-STU2_Sollas.mwlQGCZWXN7G2IoegUe1P0Vw5iGoKrkOzOaplhMSjm4"",""expires_in"":3599,""scope"":""application openid"",""token_type"":""bearer""}```### SeverityWe rate the severity as medium because the following reasons make it hard to replay tokens without the patch:�- TLS protects against MITM which makes it difficult to intercept valid tokens for replay attacks- The expiry time of the JWT gives only a short window of opportunity where it could be replayed### PatchesThis will be patched with v1.4.0+oryOS.17### WorkaroundsTwo workarounds have been identified:- Do not allow clients to use `private_key_jwt`- Use short expiry times for the JWTs### Referenceshttps://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ClientAuthentication### UpstreamThis issue will be resolved in the upstream repository https://github.com/ory/fosite",1

"[CVE-2020-0712] An uninitialized memory usage error in the latest Microsoft Edge 44.18362.387.0 may be exploited to execute arbitrary code. - Individual```javascriptclass child extends Object {    constructor(){        let f = () => {            super()++        };        f();    }}```In above snippet, we attempt to emit a load for the target of the super call. This causes us to acquire a tmp register for the target of the super call node out-of-order relative to how the tmp registers are typically acquired in `EmitSuperCall`. Then later when we release the call target location we notice that the tmp registers are being released out-of-order. Fix is to skip emitting the call target when emitting a load of a super call node - this is already handled by `EmitSuperCall` so it isn't necessary anyway.",1

"MDL-74054 core_question: Define unique question bank column IDsThis also resolves MDL-78829.Some question bank plugins use a separate class for each plugin theydefine. However, qbank_customfields (and potentially others in thefuture) uses a single class to define multiple fields. Using the classname as an ID for the column doesn't give us a way of reliableinstantiating an object for the column. Previously, qbank_customfieldsappended the field name as though it was a namespaced class, but thishad to be manually constructed and deconstructed by detecting thisparticular column class.This change introduces a standard way of constructing a unique ID foreach question bank column, in the formpluginname\columnclass-columnname. This ensures that the ID will beunique for each column, and the ID can be used to instatiate thecolumn's object.",1

"[TASK] Remove DataHandler->checkStoredRecord()Well, that functionality is hilarious: Sometimes,when the DataHandler updates or inserts databaserows, it calls checkStoredRecord() which fetchesthe just written row to verify the row hasactually been written correctly.* The implementation is inconsistent, DH does  not do this for all update queries.* The default configuration is to fetch the row,  but to *not* check the fields, rendering the  entire thing useless, but still have the  additional query.* *If* DH would actually find some collision, it  will bury that information as entry in sys_log.* We fiddled with this in #79438 for v8 already to  allow suppressing overhead via TYPO3_CONF_VARS.  These toggles are widely unknown and most likely  used very seldom.* Inserting invalid data a DB can not persist most  likely raises doctrine exceptions, especially with  many database instances being configured in ""strict""  mode nowadays.* With our current efforts to configure database  columns automatically by auto-creating them from  TCA, we further reduce the risk of columns not  being configured correctly for given data.The patch:* Removes (@internal) DataHandler->checkStoredRecord()* Keeps two related DataHandler properties as b/w  compat layer, but renders them unused.* Removes two related TYPO3_CONF_VARS.Resolves: #101793Related: #79438Related: #101553Releases: mainChange-Id: Ie93eddda48057b844067b654e327b8a371b197fcReviewed-on: https://review.typo3.org/c/Packages/TYPO3.CMS/+/80752Tested-by: Christian Kuhn <lolli@schwarzbu.ch>Reviewed-by: Andreas Fernandez <a.fernandez@scripting-base.de>Tested-by: Stefan B�rk <stefan@buerk.tech>Tested-by: Oliver Klee <typo3-coding@oliverklee.de>Tested-by: core-ci <typo3@b13.com>Reviewed-by: Oliver Klee <typo3-coding@oliverklee.de>Reviewed-by: Christian Kuhn <lolli@schwarzbu.ch>Reviewed-by: Stefan B�rk <stefan@buerk.tech>",0

"[TASK] FAL: Task object cleans up processing configurationWithin the FileProcessingService class,various cleanups regarding the configuration arraywere made in order to avoid duplicate processed files.However, as noted in the existing code, this actuallyare special cases for specific tasks (ensuring thatwidth and height are actually integers and have maxboundaries in ImagePreviewTask for example).There is a culprit though, when moving this tothe actual Task Objects (and that might be thereason why it was implemented the way it was):First, there is the ProcessedFile object, whichthen has a ->getTask() call, which then builds theTask object. The Task object thus needs a ProcessedFileobject.But the ProcessedFile object is created AFTER it waschecked in the DB based on the given configuration(which needs to be sanitized first to avoid duplicates),so a classic Chicken Egg problem.In the ideal world, the Task object should not hold stateanymore, but write everything back to the ProcessedFile(e.g. configuration) as this is still duplicated in thecurrent state.So, to reduce the interwoven situation, the AbstractTask objectnow has a new option called sanitizeConfiguration() whichat a later point should be part of the interface (= breaking),but then also work with the ProcessedFile->getProcessingConfiguration()directly to reduce the duplication of memory everywhere.For the time being, an intermediate (empty) ProcessedFileis created, a Task object is instantiated and the configurationis sanitized (in the ProcessedFileRepository), when checking in the DB if a DB entry is available.The final ProcessedFile object is re-created after the DBquery, which contains the sanitized configuration array.This change adds a new method to the Tasks, and adds somechecks regarding the method, however this should go inthe interface.As the interface will be cleaned up anyways in v13, thiswill be added separately in the next steps and the breakingchange will follow as next patch.Resolves: #102164Releases: mainChange-Id: I01d5bef97a2fa319c1bffacacf28db6ca3f9b7a3Reviewed-on: https://review.typo3.org/c/Packages/TYPO3.CMS/+/81153Tested-by: Anja Leichsenring <aleichsenring@ab-softlab.de>Tested-by: Benni Mack <benni@typo3.org>Reviewed-by: Benni Mack <benni@typo3.org>Tested-by: core-ci <typo3@b13.com>Tested-by: Stefan Bürk <stefan@buerk.tech>Reviewed-by: Stefan Bürk <stefan@buerk.tech>Reviewed-by: Anja Leichsenring <aleichsenring@ab-softlab.de>",0

"[BUGFIX] Ensure working target attribute for link.page and link.actionThe `f:link.page` ViewHelper registers an attribute for`target`, which works in extbase context. Due to somechanges, the ViewHelper has been enhanced to mitigatethe need for bootstrapping extbase in non-extbasecontexts. Therefore, `LinkFactory` (TypoLink) has beenused to build proper links in a non-extbase frontendcontext with #98474.The same principal for the different context has beenapplied to the `f:link.action` ViewHelper with #101729.That introduced a different behaviour between extbaseand non-extbase frontend context by simply overridingthe target attribute, if TypoLink generates one.This change discards the build target from the`LinkFactory` to behave equaly in non-extbase frontendcontext compared to extbase context.Additionally, tests are added to cover these cases tothe corresponding ViewHelper functional test cases.Note: If TypoScript default target configuration is      needed, the corresponding `f:link.typoscript`      ViewHelper needs to be used.Resolves: #101432Related: #101729Related: #98474Releases: main, 12.4Change-Id: Icea34983ea1f730f5ceada7d7d5ea0dbf9827204Reviewed-on: https://review.typo3.org/c/Packages/TYPO3.CMS/+/81312Tested-by: Stefan Bürk <stefan@buerk.tech>Tested-by: core-ci <typo3@b13.com>Reviewed-by: Benjamin Franzke <ben@bnf.dev>Tested-by: Benjamin Franzke <ben@bnf.dev>Reviewed-by: Stefan Bürk <stefan@buerk.tech>",1

"[SECURITY] Avoid DoS when generating Error pages TYPO3 now uses a lock strategy to avoid having to many requestwaiting for the generation of the error page (which cannot begenerated via the external HTTP request, as there might be notenough workers / PHP processes available during a DoS attack).If a lock is in place, it directly returns a generic errorresponse instead of waiting for the lock or that the errorpage is retrieved/rendered.Additionally, if the external error page could not be retrieved(HTTP status code other than 200), it will also create a genericresponse and cache that instead. This avoids keeping requestingfor the errounous external HTTP page.This could happen when using external HTTP requests (Guzzle) toresolve an error page (via PageContentErrorHandler) for 404 sites.Only TYPO3 installations using the feature ""subrequestPageErrors""via $TYPO3_CONF_VARS[SYS][features][subrequestPageErrors] = trueare not affected as the error page is generated during thesame PHP process, avoiding to create another external process.Resolves: #98384Releases: 11.5, 10.4Change-Id: Iae1cae882707a519b2cef85112525ea213a72eefSecurity-Bulletin: TYPO3-CORE-SA-2022-012Security-References: CVE-2022-23500Reviewed-on: https://review.typo3.org/c/Packages/TYPO3.CMS/+/77089Tested-by: Oliver Hader <oliver.hader@typo3.org>Reviewed-by: Oliver Hader <oliver.hader@typo3.org>",1

"[TASK] Simplify ImageProcessingInstruction objectThe introduction of the ImageProcessing objectmade it possible to refactor and clean up furthercode within TYPO3's Image processing lowlevel code.This change removes some previously addedarguments and options such as the file extension,which needs to go into a separate resolver functionality.In the same effort, the logic and usage of the infamous$info array is reduced, and a drive-by fix for addingthe quality parameter multiple times (happened inone of the previous refactorings) is added.Resolves: #102228Releases: mainChange-Id: Ifd7855236e73a225af402a359292f1256d591a5dReviewed-on: https://review.typo3.org/c/Packages/TYPO3.CMS/+/81507Reviewed-by: Oliver Klee <typo3-coding@oliverklee.de>Reviewed-by: Stefan Bürk <stefan@buerk.tech>Tested-by: Oliver Klee <typo3-coding@oliverklee.de>Tested-by: Stefan Bürk <stefan@buerk.tech>Tested-by: core-ci <typo3@b13.com>",0

"Prevents arbitrary code execution during python/object/new constructo… #386)* Prevents arbitrary code execution during python/object/new constructorIn FullLoader python/object/new constructor, implemented byconstruct_python_object_apply, has support for setting the state of adeserialized instance through the set_python_instance_state method.After setting the state, some operations are performed on the instanceto complete its initialization, however it is possible for an attackerto set the instance' state in such a way that arbitrary code is executedby the FullLoader.This patch tries to block such attacks in FullLoader by preventingset_python_instance_state from setting arbitrary properties. Itimplements a blacklist that includes `extend` method (called byconstruct_python_object_apply) and all special methods (e.g. __set__,__setitem__, etc.).Users who need special attributes being set in the state of adeserialized object can still do it through the UnsafeLoader, whichhowever should not be used on untrusted input. Additionally, they cansubclass FullLoader and redefine `get_state_keys_blacklist()` toextend/replace the list of blacklisted keys, passing the subclassedloader to yaml.load.* Make sure python/object/new constructor does not set some properties* Add test to show how to subclass FullLoader with new blacklist",1

"[!!!][TASK] Avoid TemplaVoila related FlexForm detailsA simple TCA flex form definition in extensions simply usesthe TCA 'ds' 'default' key to declare its data structure.tt_content is a bit more complex here, it uses 'ds' witha comma separated match list of two fields (ctype,list_type),defined by a 'ds_pointerField' combination to look up 'ds'keys. This is typically shadowed away for extensiondevelopers using EMU::addPiFlexFormValue().But there is more: 'ds_pointerField_searchParent','ds_pointerField_searchParent_subField' and'ds_tableField': Those allow looking up the specificdata structure of a flex form field by having thedata structure stored in a different table, includingtree traversal functionality.These three config options have been implemented forTemplaVoila back in the old days. In practice *nobody*uses these core features, even the templavoila extensionforks don't use the core implementation since they comewith xclass'es of FlexFormTools, or implement theevents.To reduce complexity, this patch now removes handling ofthese three TCA options.Note we don't migrate the TCA definitions away to notadd not needed headaches for extensions implementingfunctionality on top of it. They are just not handled incore anymore, handling can be continued by implementingthe data structure related events.Resolves: #102224Releases: mainChange-Id: Idd896a6bca179393c32360952f88bafd63de4898Reviewed-on: https://review.typo3.org/c/Packages/TYPO3.CMS/+/81503Tested-by: core-ci <typo3@b13.com>Reviewed-by: Nikita Hovratov <nikita.h@live.de>Tested-by: Nikita Hovratov <nikita.h@live.de>Tested-by: Christian Kuhn <lolli@schwarzbu.ch>Tested-by: Anja Leichsenring <aleichsenring@ab-softlab.de>Reviewed-by: Christian Kuhn <lolli@schwarzbu.ch>Reviewed-by: Anja Leichsenring <aleichsenring@ab-softlab.de>",0

"[BUGFIX] Avoid static state in LocalizationUtilityThe extbase ConfigurationManager is (unfortunately)a stateful singleton that we can not get rid ofwithout a bigger rewrite.While stateful singletons are bad enough, theextbase LocalizationUtility makes this worse byparking an instance of ConfigurationManager ina static property, re-using it as a ""cached""singleton.LocalizationUtility does this since it in itselfis static, which makes this service just soconvenient to use. When it comes to sub requestsand similar, static state is doomed and we needto get rid of it, we've had a couple of patchesin v12 dealing with similar things.Mid-term, extbase LocalizationUtility needs tovanish anyways, but in the meantime, we have toget rid of static state that kills sub request scope.The patch removes the static $configurationManagerproperty and adapts functional tests that alreadyshowed the current solution was a hack. There arevarious upper and lower cache layers that ensureremoving this ""cache layer"" won't make things moreexpensive in practice, which allows us to removethis static state without further fallback.In main, this needs a TF update:> composer u typo3/testing-frameworkIn 12.4, this need a TF raise:> composer req --dev typo3/testing-framework:^8.0.3Resolves: #101779Releases: main, 12.4Change-Id: Ie5db07b0475f612a996d369ab3417672b33fbb2dReviewed-on: https://review.typo3.org/c/Packages/TYPO3.CMS/+/80735Reviewed-by: Thomas Hohn <tho@gyldendal.dk>Reviewed-by: Benjamin Franzke <ben@bnf.dev>Tested-by: Benjamin Franzke <ben@bnf.dev>Tested-by: Christian Kuhn <lolli@schwarzbu.ch>Tested-by: core-ci <typo3@b13.com>Tested-by: Garvin Hicking <gh@faktor-e.de>Reviewed-by: Garvin Hicking <gh@faktor-e.de>Reviewed-by: Christian Kuhn <lolli@schwarzbu.ch>",1

"ssh/tailssh: fix privilege dropping on FreeBSD; add tests On FreeBSD and Darwin, changing a process's supplementary groups withsetgroups(2) will also change the egid of the process, setting it to thefirst entry in the provided list. This is distinct from the behaviour onother platforms (and possibly a violation of the POSIX standard).Because of this, on FreeBSD with no TTY, our incubator code wouldpreviously not change the process's gid, because it would read thenewly-changed egid, compare it against the expected egid, and since theymatched, not change the gid. Because we didn't use the 'login' programon FreeBSD without a TTY, this would propagate to a child process.This could be observed by running ""id -p"" in two contexts. The expectedoutput, and the output returned when running from a SSH shell, is:    andrew@freebsd:~ $ id -p    uid         andrew    groups      andrewHowever, when run via ""ssh andrew@freebsd id -p"", the output would be:    $ ssh andrew@freebsd id -p    login       root    uid         andrew    rgid        wheel    groups      andrew(this could also be observed via ""id -g -r"" to print just the gid)We fix this by pulling the details of privilege dropping out into theirown function and prepending the expected gid to the start of the list onDarwin and FreeBSD.Finally, we add some tests that run a child process, drop privileges,and assert that the final UID/GID/additional groups are what we expect.More information can be found in the following article:    https://www.usenix.org/system/files/login/articles/325-tsafrir.pdfUpdates #7616Alternative to #7609Signed-off-by: Andrew Dunham <andrew@du.nham.ca>Change-Id: I0e6513c31b121108b50fe561c89e5816d84a45b9(cherry picked from commit ccace1f)",1

This change loosens the fail fast to account for this possibility.This should not create any security issues because the `GetCallApplyCallSiteIdForCallSiteId` function can already return `NoProfile` values, but we should review carefully.",1

"Rejit when we are doing aggressive int type specialization and attempt to convert a float to an int on a loop backedge. (#6336)Fixes #6325In the POC (which repros 1.11 but requires some flags to repro in master), jitting a recursive loop body creates a situation where the type specialization of a sym in the loop prepass does not match the value types that are determined inside of the loop, leading to a lossy conversion from float64 to int32 on the backedge.This change detects the attempted lossy conversion and rejits with aggressive int type specialization disabled.",1

"Prevent `CHECK`-fail when building reference tensor. The tensor constructor does not allow reference dtypes, as these should not show up explicitly. However, when passed these invalid types instead of building an invalid object the constructor crashes via a `CHECK`-fail. We have a static builder that properly handles this case but is not applicable given current usage.Instead, before calling the constructor, we can check that the dtype is not a reference type and return an error otherwise, given that the dtype is user controlled so malicious users can trigger denial of service.PiperOrigin-RevId: 409662503Change-Id: I5892f831fde7f276cd7ab34519cf6b8061c71a59",1

Validate container size against total message size Summary:For performance reasons we preallocate golang containers withthe size given in the field header.  This allowed an attacker totrigger very large memory allocations and potentially crash the serverwith small messages.  Before creating the golang container confirmthat the message is theoretically large enough to contain a list/map/setof the given size.This requires that the binary and compact protocols use transportsthat can expose the amount of data waiting to be read.  As a result ofthis change you will not be able to do things like use the raw sockettransport or talk to endpoints over the HTTP transport that don't senda content length header.Fixes CVE-2019-11939.Differential Revision: D19595758fbshipit-source-id: 48bb9dbaf0467cea7a54602f0b07b00a8755c3f9,1

"[BUGFIX] Mitigate locale `C` in `DateFormatter` wrapping classSince PHP 8.3.0RC3 [1] the `\IntlDateFormatter` throws a`\IntlException` exception with the message:    datefmt_create: invalid locale: U_ILLEGAL_ARGUMENT_ERRORif an invalid locale is passed to the constructor. The value `C`is considered as a non-valid locale, albeit it may be set.This change introduces a fallback to `en-US` for the two methodsof the `\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Localization\DateFormatter` wrapping class,if `C` is passed as locale.`en-US` has been chosen as fallback because the TYPO3 locale class`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Localization\Locale` uses the same as fallback if`C` is provided and additional tests are added to cover the samebehaviour.Note: Other illegal locales are not handled and will allow the      exception to bubble up with PHP8.3+.[1] https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/a80db7b52aa134bdc8b9841Resolves: #102095Releases: main, 12.4Change-Id: I26d1ab74bd9dd659363320e191874f8526845158Reviewed-on: https://review.typo3.org/c/Packages/TYPO3.CMS/+/81325Reviewed-by: Oliver Klee <typo3-coding@oliverklee.de>Reviewed-by: Simon Schaufelberger <simonschaufi+typo3@gmail.com>Tested-by: Stefan Bürk <stefan@buerk.tech>Tested-by: Oliver Klee <typo3-coding@oliverklee.de>Reviewed-by: Stefan Bürk <stefan@buerk.tech>Tested-by: core-ci <typo3@b13.com>Tested-by: Markus Klein <markus.klein@typo3.org>Tested-by: Oliver Bartsch <bo@cedev.de>Reviewed-by: Markus Klein <markus.klein@typo3.org>Reviewed-by: Oliver Bartsch <bo@cedev.de>Tested-by: Simon Schaufelberger <simonschaufi+typo3@gmail.com>",1

If we used ansible_foreman_inventory for that, we would beforced to run our playbooks on a set of hosts, hostgroups, organiztionsor locations.",1

"MDL-79285 xhprof: Enable reducing runs data for quicker useHere we are reducing the xhprof runs data by removing the__Mustache==>__Mustache calls and all the orphaned data.To save N iterations what we are doing is:0. The information is ""topologically"" sorted, so we ensure that   all the parents in the data are processed before the children.   (this will help a lot when cleaning orphaned data, see below).1. First pass, all the candidate (by regexp) calls are removed   from the run data.2. Second pass, all the orphaned information (calls that have   ended losing his parent) are also removed, so data is consistent.   Note that, normally we would need N passes to remove all the   orphaned data (because each pass creates new orphan candidates),   but, as far as we have ensured that the information is topologically   sorted (see point 0 above), all this can be done in one unique pass.TODO:  - Add unit tests.  - Enable some system to be able to decide which utilities we    want to get the data reduced and which ones will continue    using the complete data. Right now the reduction is being    applied to all the utilities (both table and graph views).  - Document the change and, if implemented, the way to select    between complete/reduced data.  - Consider adding some caching to speed-up the reduction process    (some TODOs have been left in the code pointing to the critical    points).",1

"Skip Array pop fast path if prototype unsafe (#6838)The Array.prototype.pop fast path does not walk the prototype chain.That’s a problem, if a sparse array has a getter defined in it’s prototype like in issue #6824.There are 4 variants of the fast path:1. JavascriptNativeArray::PopWithNoDst2. JavascriptNativeIntArray::Pop3. JavascriptNativeFloatArray::Pop4. JavascriptArray::Pop.Behavior:The issue only occurs in the first case, if the result of .pop() is discarded, because in that case only the length of the array is reduced.If the result of a JavascriptNativeArray is stored in a variable (2 and 3), the jit method will bailout and hand over to JavascriptArray::EntryPop which will walk the prototype chain (no issue).The last case explicitly walks the prototype chain (no issue).(Related to #6598)Fix #6824",1

"Fix TensorKey hash function. The original hash function only used total estimated `AllocatedBytes()`, which (a) is an estimate per tensor, and (b) is a very poor hash function for constants (e.g. `int32_t`).It also tried to access individual tensor bytes through `tensor.data()` of size `AllocatedBytes()`.  This led to ASAN failures because the `AllocatedBytes()` is an estimate of total bytes allocated by a tensor, including any pointed-to constructs (e.g. strings), and does not refer to contiguous bytes in the `.data()` buffer.  We couldn't use this byte vector anyways, since types like `tstring` include pointers, whereas we need to hash the string values themselves.Modified the hash function to more closely mirror the `==` operator.  This correctly handles `tstring` and any numeric types that do have contiguous storage.  Other types are currently left as unimplemented.PiperOrigin-RevId: 446265413",1

"Don't replace regex / function placeholders within string literals (#79) Previously we weren't checking if the quote that started the placeholderwas escaped or not, meaning an object like    {""foo"": /1""/, ""bar"": ""a\""@__R-<UID>-0__@""}Would be serialized as    {""foo"": /1""/, ""bar"": ""a\/1""/}meaning an attacker could escape out of `bar` if they controlled both`foo` and `bar` and were able to guess the value of `<UID>`.UID was generated once on startup, was chosen using `Math.random()` andhad a keyspace of roughly 4 billion, so within the realm of an onlineattack.Here's a simple example that will cause `console.log()` to be called whenthe `serialize()`d version is `eval()`d    eval('('+ serialize({""foo"": /1"" + console.log(1)/i, ""bar"": '""@__R-<UID>-0__@'}) + ')');Where `<UID>` is the guessed `UID`.This fixes the issue by ensuring that placeholders are not preceded bya backslash.We also switch to a higher entropy `UID` to prevent people from guessing it.Co-authored-by: Jordan Milne <jmilne@uber.com>Co-authored-by: Ryan Siebert <ryan.siebert@energyaustralia.com.au>",1

"[xla:gpu] Use original buffer allocations in thunk runtime #6528Before this change, the thunk runtime  relies on LMHLO based buffer allocation, where buffer allocations order corresponds to the LMHLO entry function inputs. This makes transition to HLO-based emission difficult because we can't get LMHLO-based allocations from HLO instruction. After this change, all emitted thunks use original buffer allocations provided by buffer assignment. This enable us to do two things:1. Emit command buffer thunk directly from HLO, and it will work with other emitters2. We can gradually change thunk emission of other ops to be HLO-based. Without this change we can't test correctness of thunk runtime during the transition because HLO-based and LMHLO-based emissions don't work together.PiperOrigin-RevId: 577290271",1

It suggests there's a validator from an old instance of the network at this height (they're using the same chain-id!). Obviously a single bad validator shouldn't be an issue. But the Commit refactor work introduced a bug.When we propose a block, we get the block.LastCommit by calling MakeCommit on the set of precommits we saw for the last height. This set may include precommits for a different block, and hence the block.LastCommit we propose may include precommits that aren't actually for the last block (but of course +2/3 will be). Before v0.33, we just skipped over these precommits during verification. But in v0.33, we expect all signatures for a blockID to be for the same block ID! Thus we end up proposing a block that we can't verify.",1

"[FEATURE] Allow redirect filtering by ""protected"" stateThe redirects module does currently not allow to filter redirectsbased on the `protected` state.

"Fix signature verification issues. **SECURITY**: Three RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signature verification issues werereported by Moosa Yahyazadeh (moosa-yahyazadeh@uiowa.edu):- Leniency in checking `digestAlgorithm` structure can lead to signature  forgery.  - The code is lenient in checking the digest algorithm structure. This can    allow a crafted structure that steals padding bytes and uses unchecked    portion of the PKCS#1 encoded message to forge a signature when a low    public exponent is being used.- Failing to check tailing garbage bytes can lead to signature forgery.  - The code does not check for tailing garbage bytes after decoding a    `DigestInfo` ASN.1 structure. This can allow padding bytes to be removed    and garbage data added to forge a signature when a low public exponent is    being used.- Leniency in checking type octet.  - `DigestInfo` is not properly checked for proper ASN.1 structure. This can    lead to successful verification with signatures that contain invalid    structures but a valid digest.For more information, please see ""Bleichenbacher's RSA signature forgery basedon implementation error"" by Hal Finney:https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/openpgp/5rnE9ZRN1AokBVj3VqblGlP63QE/Fixed with the following:- [asn1] `fromDer` is now more strict and will default to ensuring all  input bytes are parsed or throw an error. A new option `parseAllBytes`  can disable this behavior.  - **NOTE**: The previous behavior is being changed since it can lead    to security issues with crafted inputs. It is possible that code    doing custom DER parsing may need to adapt to this new behavior and    optional flag.- [rsa] Add and use a validator to check for proper structure of parsed  ASN.1 `RSASSA-PKCS-v1_5` `DigestInfo` data. Additionally check that  the hash algorithm identifier is a known value. An invalid  `DigestInfo` or algorithm identifier will now cause an error to be  thrown.- [oid] Added `1.2.840.113549.2.2` / `md2` for hash algorithm checking.- [tests] Tests were added for all of the reported issues. A private  verify option was added to assist in checking multiple possible  failures in the test data.",1

"feat: add searchPattern as an option and restrict default search patt… …ern (#75)With version 15, the behavior of the environment variable lookup changed to try to find occurrences in the whole workspace. This could lead to a potential information disclosure vulnerability, by exposing environment variables meant for a backend/Node.js application.This PR mitigates this possibility, by restricting the lookup path of environment variables to `sourceRoot` of the related angular.json project and excluding files having `server` in their name (a common pattern for universal apps).",1

"[BUGFIX] Ensure correct record type for new record in SuggestWizardFormEngine sends some information as payload with the suggestwizard ajax request to the `SuggestWizardController` as context.The controller loads the record based on the tableName andthe uid to determine the recordType to read the correct TCA fieldconfiguration, respecting special overrides like `columnsOverrides`.If a new record is created, there is no record uid available andpassed to the controller. Therefore, the recordType is not properlydetermined. That leads to wrong record suggestions, if for examplethe `allowed` record table is overriden for specific recordTypes.This change adds the recordTypeValue as additional html dataattribute to the suggest search field, reads and sends it alongwith the context payload in the ajax request to the suggestwizard controller, which now uses the passed value while keepingthe record retrievement as fallback for now.Suggest records are now directly searched correctly respectingthe full TCA configuration for the type, even for new records.Additionally, uid is send as null instead of the string ""NaN"".Used command(s):> Build/Scripts/runTests.sh -s buildJavascriptResolves: #101796Releases: main, 12.4, 11.5Change-Id: I3b814d37b7d4d3e9674ad6f2af882520c4f91413Reviewed-on: https://review.typo3.org/c/Packages/TYPO3.CMS/+/80759Reviewed-by: Christian Kuhn <lolli@schwarzbu.ch>Tested-by: Christian Kuhn <lolli@schwarzbu.ch>Tested-by: Stefan B�rk <stefan@buerk.tech>Tested-by: Andreas Fernandez <a.fernandez@scripting-base.de>Reviewed-by: Stefan B�rk <stefan@buerk.tech>Tested-by: core-ci <typo3@b13.com>Reviewed-by: Andreas Fernandez <a.fernandez@scripting-base.de>Reviewed-by: Markus Hofmann <typo3@calien.de>",1

"Prevent a HTML sanitization vulnerability CVE-2021-42576A vulnerability was discovered by https://github.com/TomAnthony https://www.tomanthony.co.uk/ which allowed the contents of a `style` tag to be leaked unsanitized by bluemonday into the HTML output. Further it was demonstrated that if the form elements `select` and `option` were allowed by the policy that this could result in a successful XSS.You would only be vulnerable to if if you allowed `style`, `select` and `option` in your HTML sanitization policy:```gop := bluemonday.NewPolicy()p.AllowElements(""style"",""select"")html := p.Sanitize(`<select><option><style><script>alert(1)</script>`)fmt.Println(html)```bluemonday very strongly recommends not allowing the `style` element in a policy. It is fundamentally unsafe as we do not have a CSS sanitizer and the content is passed through unmodified.bluemonday has been updated to explicitly suppress `style` and `script` elements by default even if you do allow them by policy as these are considered unsafe. If you have a use-case for using bluemonday whilst trusting the input then you can assert this via `p.AllowUnsafe(true)` which will let `style` and `script` through if the policy also allows them.Note: the policies shipped with bluemonday are not vulnerable to this.",1

"[TASK] Use TypeScript tsconfig include instead of excludeThis helps to prevent hard-to-discover build failures, that onlyhappen on clean installs (e.g. CI).This is because TypeScript will by default scan the entire sourcedictionary (Build/ in our case) for possible includes.We previously excluded /Build/composer in #95046, but it is actuallymuch better to explicitly include the actually used source pathsto also exclude build output (Build/JavaScript/) from beingreinterpreted by subsequential eslint or tsc compile runs.Note that we also refactor the types/ directory in order tobe a folder that conforms to the @types/* packages conventions,by being actually usable in the compilerOptions.types property.Note that our custom global type definitions (types/) were previouslyimplicitly loaded as globally available sourcepaths.With the new `include` option we could add them back, but then wewouldn't notice if we do not add proper index.d.ts files (like wedid until now). Therefore index.d.ts files are added in here.Now, with TypeScript being ""clean"", we need a another smalladjustment in order for eslint to still being able to lintour types/ folder. Therefore tsconfig.json is extended toinclude the types directory. See [1] for more information onwhy eslint needs that.[1] https://typescript-eslint.io/linting/troubleshooting/#i-get-errors-telling-me-eslint-was-configured-to-run--however-that-tsconfig-does-not--none-of-those-tsconfigs-include-this-fileResolves: #101782Related: #95046Releases: main, 12.4Change-Id: I3ab8b874192d25470bbd5e71cc5d99e853259f89Reviewed-on: https://review.typo3.org/c/Packages/TYPO3.CMS/+/80739Tested-by: Andreas Fernandez <a.fernandez@scripting-base.de>Reviewed-by: Christian Kuhn <lolli@schwarzbu.ch>Reviewed-by: Andreas Fernandez <a.fernandez@scripting-base.de>Reviewed-by: Benjamin Franzke <ben@bnf.dev>Tested-by: Benjamin Franzke <ben@bnf.dev>Tested-by: Christian Kuhn <lolli@schwarzbu.ch>Tested-by: core-ci <typo3@b13.com>",0

"[RemoteFetcher] Avoid DNS Hijacking Vulnerability Reported by @claudijd**Description:**The RubyGems client supports a gem server API discovery functionality,which is used when pushing or pulling gems to a gem distribution/hostingserver, like RubyGems.org.  This functionality is provided via a SRV DNSrequest to the users gem source hostname prepended with ""_rubygems._tcp."".The response to this request tells the RubyGems client (aka: the gemcommand) where the users gem server API is.  In the default RubyGemsscenario, with a gem source of https://rubygems.org, the users SRV DNSrequest and reply will look like this:    ~ $ dig srv _rubygems._tcp.rubygems.org +short    0 1 80 api.rubygems.org.Due to a deficiency in DNS response verification, a MiTM positionedattacker can poison the DNS response to this record response and forcethe client to unknowingly download and install Ruby gems from an attackercontrolled gem server in an alternate security domain.  An example ofsuch a scenario would look like so:    ~ $ dig _rubygems._tcp.rubygems.org SRV +short    0 0 53 evil.com/api.rubygems.com.In such a scenario, the attacker is able to serve the client malicious gemcontent, resulting in trivial remote code execution scenarios.  Forexample, the attacker could simply modify the gem source code and triggercode execution via the extensions API at install time on the client machine(a gem trojaning technique described by Ben Smith in his ""Hacking withGems"" presentation at Aloha Ruby Conference in 2012 -https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-5bO0Q1J9s)/This vulnerability has the same net effect/impact as [CVE-2015-3900](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2015-3900) and[CVE-2015-4020](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2015-4020).**Affected method in Gem::RemoteFetcher:**https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/blob/5096fa35c1ca3e0a7d175aaf9d77cd93114fd977/lib/rubygems/remote_fetcher.rb#L101-L119**PoC DNS SRV Responder:**    #!/usr/bin/env ruby    require 'rubydns'    require 'rubydns/system'    INTERFACES = [    	[:udp, ""0.0.0.0"", 53],    	[:tcp, ""0.0.0.0"", 53]    ]    Name = Resolv::DNS::Name    IN = Resolv::DNS::Resource::IN    RubyDNS::run_server(:listen => INTERFACES) do      match(//, IN::SRV) do |transaction|        transaction.respond!(0,0,53,""evil.com/api.rubygems.com"")      end    end**Fix:**By parsing the returned target as a URI and only matching against the`hostname`, we can ensure that only subdomains of the original hostare redirected to.

"Allow ref byte to point just past the end of spans (#73) Motivation----------I was under the impression that `ref byte` should never point past theend of a `Span<byte>` or `ReadOnlySpan<byte>` because then GC couldn'trecognize the pointer and adjust it during GC moves. However, this thereis a specific exception that allows `ref byte` to point precisely onebyte past the end and still be recognized to allow pointer arithmeticscenarios like the ones in this algorithm.Modifications-------------Where there is more complex logic (compared to the reference C++implementation) to allow buffer end pointers to point to the last bytein the buffer simplify this logic and point one byte past the end of thebuffer.Also ensure that comparison operations that ensure a certain lengthdon't involve an intermediate pointer that moves off the beginning ofthe buffer.Results-------We're now back to closer to the reference C++ implementation but stillhave memory safety.",1
"Fix signature verification issues. **SECURITY**: Three RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signature verification issues werereported by Moosa Yahyazadeh (moosa-yahyazadeh@uiowa.edu):- Leniency in checking `digestAlgorithm` structure can lead to signature  forgery.  - The code is lenient in checking the digest algorithm structure. This can    allow a crafted structure that steals padding bytes and uses unchecked    portion of the PKCS#1 encoded message to forge a signature when a low    public exponent is being used.- Failing to check tailing garbage bytes can lead to signature forgery.  - The code does not check for tailing garbage bytes after decoding a    `DigestInfo` ASN.1 structure. This can allow padding bytes to be removed    and garbage data added to forge a signature when a low public exponent is    being used.- Leniency in checking type octet.  - `DigestInfo` is not properly checked for proper ASN.1 structure. This can    lead to successful verification with signatures that contain invalid    structures but a valid digest.For more information, please see ""Bleichenbacher's RSA signature forgery basedon implementation error"" by Hal Finney:https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/openpgp/5rnE9ZRN1AokBVj3VqblGlP63QE/Fixed with the following:- [asn1] `fromDer` is now more strict and will default to ensuring all  input bytes are parsed or throw an error. A new option `parseAllBytes`  can disable this behavior.  - **NOTE**: The previous behavior is being changed since it can lead    to security issues with crafted inputs. It is possible that code    doing custom DER parsing may need to adapt to this new behavior and    optional flag.- [rsa] Add and use a validator to check for proper structure of parsed  ASN.1 `RSASSA-PKCS-v1_5` `DigestInfo` data. Additionally check that  the hash algorithm identifier is a known value. An invalid  `DigestInfo` or algorithm identifier will now cause an error to be  thrown.- [oid] Added `1.2.840.113549.2.2` / `md2` for hash algorithm checking.- [tests] Tests were added for all of the reported issues. A private  verify option was added to assist in checking multiple possible  failures in the test data.",1

"[BREAKING] [Security] Fix RCE vulnerability Fix a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability identified in anexcellent report by Timo Mihaljov (@solita-timo-mihaljov).You are vulnerable iff both:  1. You are using Nippy to serialize and deserialize data from an     UNTRUSTED SOURCE.  2. You have a vulnerable (""gadget"") class on your classpath.     Notably Clojure <= 1.8 includes such a class [1].     Many other libraries do too, some examples at [2].To prevent this risk, a Serialization whitelist has been added.Any classes not *explicitly* authorized by the whitelist to useSerialization will NOT be permitted to.The default whitelist is EMPTY, meaning this is a BREAKINGchange iff you make use of Nippy's Serialization support. Inthis case, you'll need to update the whitelist for your needs.For more info see the `*serializable-whitelist*` docstring.[1] https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/CLJ-2204[2] https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserialFurther info below provided by Timo:------------------------------------Deserialization vulnerabilities are exploited by constructing objects of classeswhose constructors perform some action that's useful to the attacker. A class likethis is called a gadget, and a collection of such classes that can be combined toreach the attacker's goal is called a gadget chain.There are three prerequisites for exploiting a deserialization vulnerability:  1) The attacker must be able to control the deserialized data, for example,     by gaining write access to the data store where trusted parties serialize     data or by exploiting some other vulnerability on the other end of a     communications channel.  2) The deserializer must construct objects of classes specified in the     serialized data. In other words, the attacker must have full control over     which classes get instantiated.  3) The classpath must contain gadgets that can be combined into a gadget chain.The vulnerable code is in Nippy's function `read-serializable`, which calls the`readObject` method of `ObjectInputStream`.I have only tested the PoC with the latest stable version, 2.14.0, but looking atNippy's Git history, I believe all versions starting with the following commitare vulnerable:    commit 9448d2b    [Thu Oct 24 13:47:25 2013 +0700]For a user to be affected, they must:  1) use Nippy to serialize untrusted input, and  2) have a gadget chain on their classpath.I suspect (but haven't verified) that using Nippy's encryption feature preventsexploitation in some cases, but if it's used to encrypt the communications betweentwo systems, one compromised endpoint could send encrypted butattacker-controlled data to the other.Ysoserial [4] contains a list of some Java libraries with known gadget chains.If any of those libraries can be found on the user's classpath, they are knownto be vulnerable. (Ysoserial's list is not exhaustive, so even if a user doesn'thave these particular libraries on their classpath, they may still have someother gadget chains loaded.)Unfortunately Clojure versions before 1.9 contained a gadget chain in thestandard library [5][6], so all Nippy users running Clojure 1.8 or earlierare vulnerable. (Note that users of later Clojure versions may or may notbe vulnerable, depending on whether they have gadget chains from otherlibraries on their classpath.)[4] https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial[5] https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/clojure/WaL3hHzsevI/7zHU-L7LBQAJ[6] https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/CLJ-2204",1

"Improve heuristics preventing CPU/memory abuse (#515) This addresses the following items:==== Parse time of excessively deep nested or indented documentsParsing these documents is non-linear; limiting stack depth to 10,000 keeps parse times of pathological documents sub-second (~.25 seconds in benchmarks)==== Alias node expansion limitsThe current limit allows 10,000% expansion, which is too permissive for large documents.Limiting to 10% expansion for larger documents allows callers to use input size as an effective way to limit resource usage. Continuing to allow larger expansion rates (up to the current 10,000% limit) for smaller documents does not unduly affect memory use.This change bounds decode operations from alias expansion to ~400,000 operations for small documents (worst-case ~100-150MB) or 10% of the input document for large documents, whichever is greater.",1

"🔒 Make session handling more secure * 🔒️ Tie remember_me cookie to password hashThat way when the password gets changed,existing cookies automatically getinvalidated.* 🔒️ Invalidate user sessions on password changeThis will require a user to log in again aftertheir password is changed, either by themselvesor through an admin.This is a slight change in behaviour comparedto before, but makes sure password changesare enforced across all existing sessions.* ♻️ remember_key_for_user => signature_key_for_user* 🔒️ Invalidate sessions after 15min of inactivityThe server has been keeping track of loginsession for a while, but now it also onlyconsiders such (active login) sessions freshthat have been active within the past 15min.That way, a session cookie's lifetime is nowalso restricted server side. An activesocket connection suffices to keep thesession alive, as do any other requestsusing the cookie.As the session tracking happens in-memory,all sessions will become invalid on serverrestart. However, if the remember me cookieis set, after server restart a passivelogin will succeed.* 🔒️ Limit remember_me validity to 90 daysSo far that was only done through the cookieduration, and with a year to boot. Now weencode the creation date into the cookieand check against that, if it exceeds thecookie duration the cookie is consideredunset.Will prevent reuse of ancient remember mecookies (and force the user to login atleast once every 90d).* 💚 Fix unit testsNew cookie handling requires a faked flaskconfig object.Related: https://huntr.dev/bounties/d27d232b-2578-4b32-b3b4-74aabdadf629/",1

"Security: rename WEBHOOK_AUTHORIZATION --> WEBHOOK_SECRET This fixes a low severity security issue affecting Anymail v0.2--v1.3.Django error reporting includes the value of your AnymailWEBHOOK_AUTHORIZATION setting. In a properly-configured deployment,this should not be cause for concern. But if you have somehow exposedyour Django error reports (e.g., by mis-deploying with DEBUG=True or bysending error reports through insecure channels), anyone who gainsaccess to those reports could discover your webhook shared secret. Anattacker could use this to post fabricated or malicious Anymailtracking/inbound events to your app, if you are using those Anymailfeatures.The fix renames Anymail's webhook shared secret setting so thatDjango's error reporting mechanism will [sanitize][0] it.If you are using Anymail's event tracking and/or inbound webhooks, youshould upgrade to this release and change ""WEBHOOK_AUTHORIZATION"" to""WEBHOOK_SECRET"" in the ANYMAIL section of your settings.py. You mayalso want to [rotate the shared secret][1] value, particularly if youhave ever exposed your Django error reports to untrusted individuals.If you are only using Anymail's EmailBackends for sending email andhave not set up Anymail's webhooks, this issue does not affect you.The old WEBHOOK_AUTHORIZATION setting is still allowed in this release,but will issue a system-check warning when running most Djangomanagement commands. It will be removed completely in a near-futurerelease, as a breaking change.Thanks to Charlie DeTar (@yourcelf) for responsibly reporting thissecurity issue through private channels.[0]: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#debug[1]: https://anymail.readthedocs.io/en/1.4/tips/securing_webhooks/#use-a-shared-authorization-secret",1

[CVE-2019-0924] ,1
"Add missing bounds check to FamStructWrapper::deserialize An issue was discovered in the `Versionize::deserialize`implementation provided by the `versionize` crate for`vmm_sys_utils::fam::FamStructWrapper`, which can lead to out ofbounds memory accesses. Objects of this type are used to modelstructures containing C-style flexible array members [1]. Thesestructures contain a memory allocation that is prefixed by a headercontaining the size of the allocation.Due to treating the header and the memory allocation as two objects,`Versionize`'s data format stores the size of the allocation twice:once in the header and then again as its own metadata of the memoryallocation. A serialized `FamStructWrapper` thus looks as follows:+------------------------------------------------------------+\| header (containing length of flexible array member `len1`) |\+------------------------------------------------------------+\+---------------------------------------+-----------------------+| length of flexible array member`len2` | array member contents |+---------------------------------------+-----------------------+During deserialization, the library separately deserializes theheader and the memory allocation. It allocates `len2` bytes ofmemory, and then prefixes it with the separately deserialized header.Since `len2` is an implementation detail of the `Versionize`implementation, it is forgotten about at the end of the deserialize`function`, and all subsequent operations on the `FamStructWrapper`assume the memory allocated to have size `len1`. If deserializationinput was malformed such that `len1 != len2`, then this can lead to(safe) functions on ´FamStructWrapper` to read past the end ofallocated memory (if `len1 > len2`).The issue was corrected by inserting a check that verifies that thesetwo lengths are equal, and aborting deserialization otherwise.[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexible_array_memberSigned-off-by: Patrick Roy <roypat@amazon.co.uk>",1

"[BUGFIX] Simplify regex for form finisher FlexForm overridesEXT:form automatically generates FlexForm for form finisher overridesbased on YAML configuration in the `finishersDefinition.FormEngine`sub-array. Since the removal of `TCEforms` for FlexForm (#97126), theregex to match valid FlexForm fields did a ""too good"" job and alsoadded fields from section containers. These were guarded by a negativelookbehind `(?>!\.TCEforms)`. Note the dot. This basically means ignoreanything, which has something else before TCEforms (=sections).This was mostly fixed with #101050 by ignoring anything with a dotbefore `config.type`. Sadly, this also ignored FlexForm identifiers withdots in their name. In this case `translation.language.config.type`.This whole regex thing is a mess and partially was the reason theseissues started as soon as something changed in the FlexForm syntax. Now,in order to fix this, section containers are kicked from the array withplain old PHP logic. This way we don't need to come up with a supersmart regex like ""anything that ends with `config.type` but not precededby `_arrayContainer`"". I tried and I failed.Resolves: #102250Related: #101050Related: #97126Releases: main, 12.4Change-Id: I5549bdcfcda1b8dc014c11933b140d5c671c36e1Reviewed-on: https://review.typo3.org/c/Packages/TYPO3.CMS/+/81581Reviewed-by: Christian Kuhn <lolli@schwarzbu.ch>Tested-by: Stefan Bürk <stefan@buerk.tech>Reviewed-by: Stefan Bürk <stefan@buerk.tech>Tested-by: core-ci <typo3@b13.com>Tested-by: Christian Kuhn <lolli@schwarzbu.ch>",0

"[!!!][TASK] Remove cache_imagesizesThis change removes the cache ""imagesizes"" alongwith the public methods within GraphicalFunctions.The main reason for having cache_imagesizes back inTYPO3 v4.x was that detecting the image sizes was donevia ImageMagick solely.Nowadays, the ImageInfo functionality is used,which uses- getimagesize()- exif_read_data()before falling back to ImageMagick identify.Most places in TYPO3 Core already use ImageInfo directlywithout using the cache.A image size calculation is nowadays with SSD much fasterthan a decade before, whereas a DB cache (by default) forcache_imagesizes has a much more latency.As cache_imagesizes is solely used for local files,remote FAL drivers do not have a problem here as well.Removed public methods:- GraphicalFunctions->cacheImageDimensions()- GraphicalFunctions->getCachedImageDimensions()The main public method GraphicalFunctions->getImageDimensions()still continues to exist and work as before.Resolves: #102009Releases: mainChange-Id: I6075e796b5e729733bd60eb7d2e005f5f5cc4b33Reviewed-on: https://review.typo3.org/c/Packages/TYPO3.CMS/+/81105Tested-by: Benni Mack <benni@typo3.org>Reviewed-by: Stefan Bürk <stefan@buerk.tech>Reviewed-by: Christian Kuhn <lolli@schwarzbu.ch>Tested-by: Christian Kuhn <lolli@schwarzbu.ch>Tested-by: Stefan Bürk <stefan@buerk.tech>Reviewed-by: Benni Mack <benni@typo3.org>Tested-by: core-ci <typo3@b13.com>",0

"Improve convert_tf_quant_to_mhlo_int_testThis is aiming at easier numerical verification of quant->int lowering passes.This CL implements a function to evaluate TF function return value using constant-folding utility in TF quantizer. Under the hood, it uses TF kernels to numerically evaluate TF ops.Then we execute the lowered int graph using PJRT client and verify the results against TF kernel results. This makes creating test cases easier because we don't need to manually calculate the expected results.There appears to be some numerical differences for dot.

"[BUGFIX] Avoid redirect loop for empty redirect urlSending a redirect response with a empty `Location` isinvalid per RFC. Browser vendor are dealing differntlywith it.* Firefox executes a redirect to the current url, leading  to an `endless` redirect chain - stopping it after some  recursions with a coresponding notice in the network tab.* Chrome determines this and is doing nothing at all with  it - leading to a white page.From the [1] RFC regarding invalid URI spec for `Location`:> Note: Some recipients attempt to recover from Location>       fields that are not valid URI references. This>       specification does not mandate or define such>       processing, but does allow it for the sake of>       robustness.A matching redirect record with a manually entered `/` asredirect target leads in TYPO3 v11 to this behaviour. Thiscan be mitigated by selecting the corresponding site root.For TYPO3 v12 and upwards a change in the LinkHandling hasbeen introduced which properly handles the `/` in the linkgeneration and correctly returning a `/` as redirect url.That change has quite some impact and is not reasonable tobe backported to TYPO3 v11 within #100958.This change adds an additionally guard to the `RedirectHandler`to handle empty redirect urls as endless loop, just loggingit and not responding with an redirect. This helps in v11 andkeeps a safety guard for the future in this place.[1] https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231#section-7.1.2Resolves: #100791Related: #100958Releases: main, 12.4, 11.5Change-Id: I2af2d5bf759a277ade45bd0f7740ffe0099003b3Reviewed-on: https://review.typo3.org/c/Packages/TYPO3.CMS/+/80983Tested-by: core-ci <typo3@b13.com>Tested-by: Benni Mack <benni@typo3.org>Tested-by: Rafael Kähm <rafael.kaehm@dkd.de>Reviewed-by: Rafael Kähm <rafael.kaehm@dkd.de>Tested-by: Stefan Bürk <stefan@buerk.tech>Reviewed-by: Benni Mack <benni@typo3.org>Reviewed-by: Stefan Bürk <stefan@buerk.tech>Reviewed-by: Oliver Klee <typo3-coding@oliverklee.de>",1

"Copying the latest maintenance patch for 9.2 to the GitHub repo: - Fixed a bug when choosing a password in the installer, where the admin installing still   saw an incorrect message saying that the password needed to be at least 10 characters   long. (Our password requirements are now more sophisticated.) - When installing the CMS, if you leave the site after running the installer but before   picking a language, we've improved the navigation when you return. - Fixed a bug where the ""A site is being built at this location. If you are a site   administrator please click here"" message on a fresh site would be blank in certain   situations. - To reduce the filesize of our zip/tar/7z files, we no longer bundle the Payson, phpMQTT   or YUI Compressor libraries in with the download of Zenario. - If you try to run our minifier tool, it will now display a message to tell you that   Closure Compiler and YUI Compressor libraries are missing, and give you instructions on   how to download them. - Fixed a bug where our minifier tool would crash with a PHP error if run on a release   version of the CMS. - When registering a new custom file type, you can no longer register .phar files as an   accepted file type. - .phar files are now globally blocked from being uploaded. - Gridmaker has received a few fixes for some visual problems that it previously had.   You should see that elements show now correctly line up with the grid lines, rather   than be a few pixels off as they were previously. - Pinning or unpinnning a content item is now flagged as a change. This means that the   message on the admin toolbar will alert you that something has changed on a draft if it   is pinned and the published version is unpinned (or vice versa). - Fixed a PHP error that appeared if you tried to edit the privacy of multiple content   items at once. - Fixed a bug when editing a WYSIWYG editor next to a nest, where you could interact with   the nest controls whilst still editing, causing buggy behaviour. - Fixed a bug where using the ""First breadcrumb -> Use the home page"" setting in the   breadcrumbs plugin would cause a PHP notice. - Fixed a mistake where titles and messages in the Content Summary List plugins were   double-escaped. - Fixed a bug in Organizer where junk data would sometimes appear in the   ""where it's used"" column. - Fixed a graphical glitch where the icons in the ""where it's used"" column sometimes did   not appear next to their labels. - We've removed support for using a video from Vimeo in the Video cType plugin, as this   functionality was broken and not working. If you were using this feature, please   migrate to using the HTML Snippet plugin instead. - Fixed a bug that prevented Vimeo videos from using their fullscreen button when   included using the HTML Snippet plugin. - When displaying a list of video categories in the front end, they are now sorted by   name and not by the order you created them in.Finally, we've started to work towards supporting PHP version 8.1. This patch containsseveral fixes that will allow Zenario to run on PHP 8.1. However, note that this is workin progress and not yet fully complete. We are still recommending that you run Zenariousing either PHP 7.4 or 8.0 for non-development sites.",1

"Merge pull request from GHSA-gwc9-348x-qwv2 * Run the GC smoketest with epoch support enabled as well.* Handle safepoints in cold blocks properly.Currently, the way that we find safepoint slots for a given instructionrelies on the instruction index order in the safepoint list matching theorder of instruction emission.Previous to the introduction of cold-block support, this was triviallysatisfied by sorting the safepoint list: we emit instructions 0, 1, 2,3, 4, ..., and so if we have safepoints at instructions 1 and 4, we willencounter them in that order.However, cold blocks are supported by swizzling the emission order atthe last moment (to avoid having to renumber instructions partwaythrough the compilation pipeline), so we actually emit instructions outof index order when cold blocks are present.Reference-type support in Wasm in particular uses cold blocks forslowpaths, and has live refs and safepoints in these slowpaths, so wecan reliably ""skip"" a safepoint (not emit any metadata for it) in thepresence of reftype usage.This PR fixes the emission code by building a map from instruction indexto safepoint index first, then doing lookups through this map, ratherthan following along in-order as it emits instructions.",1

"[TASK] Pin to PER Coding Style v1.0PER-CS2.0 was added as clone of PER-CS1.0 in php-cs-fixer v3.27in order to implement the new rules that are defined inPER Coding Style 2.0 [1]. The alias PER already points to PER-CS2.0although the current set of rules are not implemented yet. [2]There is only one rule (single_line_empty_body) that is done by nowand more will follow, so we rather pin to PER-CS1.0 for now (andenable single_line_empty_body which we already migrated to) inorder to prevent having coding style changes with everyphp-cs-fixer raise.

This would normally happen when thecontents of the union field is switched to a different oneofitem, instead of merging with the same one.This commit changes it so that the field is memset() only when`which_field` contains a different tag.",1

Use a template literal for string coercion in the default sort compare - does toString() instead of the incorrect toString(toPrimitive()) that was done before AND due to the change in (2) above is significantly more efficient.4. Some drive by cleanup.",0

"[XlaCallModule] Improved support for effects and version 9.Previously, XlaCallModule op supported only at most one token and ithad to appear at the start of the arguments and results. Now we lookfor token types among the input and result types. This allows us tosupport more than one token and not necessarily at the start. This isuseful when the module is serialized from JAX, which uses one tokenfor each distinct effect, and the tokens may appear after the platformindex argument in presence of multi-platform lowering.We also fix the bitcast operations introduced prior to shape refinementto add them only when needed: for non-tokens with dynamic shapes.This introduces version 9 of XlaCallModuleOp.See https://github.com/google/jax/blob/main/jax/experimental/jax2tf/README.md#native-serialization-versionsfor a description of the different versions.PiperOrigin-RevId: 577032011",0

We recommend everyone update their copy of Zenario as soon aspossible.Other security updates----------------------This update also patches a couple of minor security vulnerabilities in admin mode.There was a small hole in our SVG sanitiser script, which mean it was still possible tocreate a SVG with a XSS attack hidden inside and upload it, where we accepted SVG uploads.We've also fixed a small issue where the administrator's name was not being HTML escapedon the diagnostics screen.Both of these issues are not considered critical as someone would already needadministrator access before they could exploit them.Miscellaneous-------------The fix for URLs being blocked from Google if friendly URLs was turned off has beenpatched back to 9.0 as well as a few other miscellaneous fixes.",1

"vuln-fix: Zip Slip Vulnerability This fixes a Zip-Slip vulnerability.This change does one of two things. This change either1. Inserts a guard to protect against Zip Slip.OR2. Replaces `dir.getCanonicalPath().startsWith(parent.getCanonicalPath())`, which is vulnerable to partial path traversal attacks, with the more secure `dir.getCanonicalFile().toPath().startsWith(parent.getCanonicalFile().toPath())`.For number 2, consider `""/usr/outnot"".startsWith(""/usr/out"")`.The check is bypassed although `/outnot` is not under the `/out` directory.It's important to understand that the terminating slash may be removed when using various `String` representations of the `File` object.For example, on Linux, `println(new File(""/var""))` will print `/var`, but `println(new File(""/var"", ""/"")` will print `/var/`;however, `println(new File(""/var"", ""/"").getCanonicalPath())` will print `/var`.Weakness: CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')Severity: HighCVSSS: 7.4Detection: CodeQL (https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/java/java-zipslip/) & OpenRewrite (https://public.moderne.io/recipes/org.openrewrite.java.security.ZipSlip)Reported-by: Jonathan Leitschuh <Jonathan.Leitschuh@gmail.com>Signed-off-by: Jonathan Leitschuh <Jonathan.Leitschuh@gmail.com>Bug-tracker: JLLeitschuh/security-research#16Co-authored-by: Moderne <team@moderne.io>",1

"Enable defer parse for class members including constructorsWe have the ability to defer parse any function except for class members (which includes explicit class constructors). Class members are basically parsed in the same way as object literal methods so it isn't very hard to support defer parsing for them since we already support defer parsing for object literal methods.The main complication here is supporting the unusual text extents for class constructors. The class constructor function itself is what we will eventually bind to the name of the class. However, calling toString on the class name should print the text of the entire class. We also need to know the exact text extents for the constructor method in order to defer parse it. There's already a mechanism we use to adjust the beginning of the text extents for async methods so I've extended this to support adjusting the length of the extents as well. We used to keep track of an extra uint tacked-on to FunctionBody but I moved this into a struct of two uints stored in the AuxPtr array instead. This struct is only allocated for objects with unusual text extents.Besides the text extents work, the remainder is mostly just bookkeeping various flags to let us know we're parsing a class constructor, derived constructor, class member, etc.",0

"[!!!][TASK] Remove FlexFormTools traverserWith various pre-patches being done, the ugly traversermethod FlexFormTools->traverseFlexFormXMLData() isobsolete.This final patch to FlexFormTools removes that methodand its helper from the codebase. We're activelyremoving the method and skip a deprecation phase inthis case: First, the method is low level and usuallynot used by extension developers. Extensions likethe TemplaVoila forks have their own implementationsof FlexFormTools already, their migration is straightforward. Secondly, we probably want to further simplifyFlexForm related details, maintaining the old traverserwould be a hindrance since it's so hard to follow.FlexFormTools is now a stateless service. The patchcomes with a .rst file mentioning the changes, anddocuments some details from previous patches.Resolves: #102229Related: #102218Related: #102212Releases: mainChange-Id: I866e8c92c07753b8c53ae3d8233c55d35614cb85Reviewed-on: https://review.typo3.org/c/Packages/TYPO3.CMS/+/81504Tested-by: Stefan Bürk <stefan@buerk.tech>Reviewed-by: Benni Mack <benni@typo3.org>Tested-by: core-ci <typo3@b13.com>Reviewed-by: Stefan Bürk <stefan@buerk.tech>Tested-by: Benni Mack <benni@typo3.org>",0

"ensure that inherited files are nonblocking The Go runtime has annoying behaviour around setting and clearingO_NONBLOCK: exec.Cmd.Start() ends up calling os.File.Fd() for anyfile in exec.Cmd.ExtraFiles. os.File.Fd() disables both the useof the runtime poller for the file and clears O_NONBLOCK fromthe underlying open file descriptor.Disabling the runtime poller is bad because it makes operating onthose files less efficient. We can work around this by alwaysworking on duplicate os.File. Since the library itself neverreads or writes from the files it doesn't matter whether theruntime poller is enabled or not.Clearing O_NONBLOCK is much more annoying, since it's shared byall fds pointing to the same open file descriptor. This can leadto hard to diagnose hangs in code invoking syscalls on the filedescriptors, like read or accept. Even more troubling, File.Closedoesn't interrupt these syscalls anymore. Depending on how theapplication is structured this can lead to indefinite hangs.Fix this by writing a simplified wrapper around syscall.StartProcess.It turns out that we don't need most features of exec.Cmd anyways.A full restart is needed to make files non-blocking again indeployed processes.",1

"Improve testing and escaping of newlines (#332) * Don't ignore newlines when fuzzingUpdate the fuzzing logic to not ignore newline characters anymore. ForBash, Dash, PowerShell, and Zsh this is reflected by the removal of    arg = arg.replace(/[\n\r]+/g, """");from the `exec.test.cjs` fuzz target. For CMD it is (additionally) theremoval of    arg = arg.replace(/[\n\r]+/g, """");in the `_common.cjs` fuzz logic.The inclusion of newlines in input arguments required some changes tothe `getExpectedOutput` function to account for the individual shell'shandling of these characters, typically removing them from the start andend of the input. (Note: not all changes to `getExpectedOutput` are dueto this.)* Update the fuzz corpus- `31ed764`: contains a trailing forward slash ('\\') character that  was echod as a double quote ('""') character by CMD due to carriage  return ('\r') characters not being escaped.- `dece2a6`: contains a line feed ('\n') character and a tilde where the  tilde should be escaped but wasn't for Bash.- `f28febc`: contains a carriage return ('\r') character and a tilde  where the tilde should be escaped but wasn't for Bash.- `faf3c25`: contains a line feed ('\n') character inside of curly  braces where the opening curly bracket should be escaped but wasn't  for bash.The remaining new items in the fuzz corpus (`036053b`, `71ef6c5`, and`f1d97ce`) we're added based on fuzzing with whitespace for PowerShell.* Update macro for executing fixturesUpdate the macro for executing fixtures to properly display all thewhitespace characters as distinct characters. This is required becauseotherwise test names will be considered duplicates.Whitespace characters with common shorthands are display using thatshorthand (e.g. '\n' for line feed). Other characters will be displayedby their unicode index (similar to the null character). This has beennormalized to the `\u{hhhh}` notation for consistency where the curlybraces are included to improve readability of the test title (clearlydemarcating the end of the unicode index from any characters that mightfollow it).* Escape newlines for PowerShellFor PowerShell only line feed ('\n') and carriage return ('\r')characters need to be escaped, and only when `interpolation` is `true`.This is supported by manual testing as well as fuzzing.From manual testing (see [2]) it turned out that all character exceptfor line feed ('\n'), carriage return ('\r'), and '\uFEFF' are convertedto a normal space by PowerShell so it isn't necessary to escape them.For '\uFEFF', it was found that it is interpreted as is and doesn'tcause any problems.The test fixtures for PowerShell were updated to include examples wherewhitespace characters need or need not be escaped.* Escape newlines for CMDFor CMD only line feed ('\n') and carriage return ('\r') characters needto be escaped, but those need to be escaped always. This is supported bymanual testing as well as fuzzing.From manual testing (see [2]) it turned out that line feed ('\n')characters cause CMD to omit the remaining input;  carriage return('\r') could change the interpretation of certain characters; tab ('\t')characters are converted to normal spaces; and all other whitespacecharacters are interpreted as is.The test fixtures for CMD were updated to include examples wherewhitespace characters need or need not be escaped.* Escape newlines for Bash, Dash, and ZshFor the supported Unix shells only the line feed ('\n') character needsto be escaped, and only when `interpolation` is `true`. This issupported by manual testing as well as fuzzing.From manual testing (see [2]) it turned out that line feed ('\n') andcharacters cause the whatever follows it to be interpreted as a newcommand; tab ('\t') characters are converted to normal spaces; and allother whitespace characters are interpreted as is.The test fixtures for Bash, Dash, and Zsh were updated to includeexamples where whitespace characters need or need not be escaped.* Improve escaping of tilde for BashFor Bash escape the tilde ('~') character if a line terminatingcharacter ('\n', '\r', '\u2028', or '\u2029') appears between and""opening"" equals sign ('=') and a ""closing"" colon-tilde ("":~""). Thiscase was missed previously because the regular expression `/./` does notindeed match all characters, but only those that are not lineterminating characters (even with the multiline flag).

"[c#] Fix OutputBuffer.Grow geometric growth regression Recently, in order to mitigate CVE-2020-1469, among other changes inb0fd4a1 ([c#] Fix handling of large container lengths, 2020-07-06),`OutputBuffer.Grow` changed from `length += length >> 1` to `length =checked(length + length >> 1)`. This actually doesn't change the valueof `length`, because `+` has [higher precedence][1] than `>>`. `length`gets doubled and then divided by two, so it remains unchanged (exceptwhen overflow occurs). This causes serious performance regression as theunderlying buffer is then grown by single byte at a time instead ofgrowing by half of current size.The fix is to use `length = checked(length + (length >> 1))` toexplicitly perform the shift before the addition.Fixes #1065Closes #1066[1]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/#operator-precedence",1

"[!!!][TASK] Decouple FileRepository and ProcessedFileRepositoryWhen FAL was introduced in TYPO3 v6.0, some conceptswere introduced which aren't so smart, 11 years later.* Building an AbstractRepository* Using Extbase RepositoryInterface in FAL repositoriesThe shared code between the two implementingclasses, FileRepository and AbstractFileRepositoryisn't justified to use an AbstractRepository whichdynamically creates objects through inheritancefor its subclass repositories.Instead, the AbstractRepository is now removed andboth FileRepository and ProcessedFileRepositoryare now free, and can also use DI in a way it was meant.For this reason, the whole AbstractRepository classwithin the ""TYPO3\CMS\Core\Resource"" namespace is removedalong with the dependency to Extbase in this regard.FileRepository and ProcessedFileRepository now onlycontain the methods they require, and all methods andproperties are fully typed.Resolves: #101948Releases: mainChange-Id: I5a1f1fb899e94836cb16c85c2048df264fd59813Reviewed-on: https://review.typo3.org/c/Packages/TYPO3.CMS/+/81081Tested-by: core-ci <typo3@b13.com>Tested-by: Benni Mack <benni@typo3.org>Reviewed-by: Christian Kuhn <lolli@schwarzbu.ch>Reviewed-by: Göran Bodenschatz <g.bodenschatz@ecentral.de>Tested-by: Andreas Nedbal <andy@pixelde.su>Reviewed-by: Oliver Klee <typo3-coding@oliverklee.de>Tested-by: Oliver Klee <typo3-coding@oliverklee.de>Reviewed-by: Andreas Nedbal <andy@pixelde.su>Reviewed-by: Benni Mack <benni@typo3.org>Tested-by: Christian Kuhn <lolli@schwarzbu.ch>",0

This allows specific modules tobe loaded ondemand and has the additional advantage that plugin authorscan use modules via packages exports as suggested by upstreamdocumentation. This should lower the the barrier for writing customplugins.The existing bundle @typo3/ckeditor5-bundle is still inplace and acts as wrapper for the split bundles. It isdeprecated and will be removed in TYPO3 v13.0.Also worth noting is that terser is now used toshrink the module size.Resolves: #102099Releases: main, 12.4Change-Id: I873167a7cb5c04cb7ef34e943830879f3f78eaaaReviewed-on: https://review.typo3.org/c/Packages/TYPO3.CMS/+/81323Tested-by: core-ci <typo3@b13.com>Tested-by: Benjamin Kott <benjamin.kott@outlook.com>Reviewed-by: Stefan Bürk <stefan@buerk.tech>Tested-by: Benjamin Franzke <ben@bnf.dev>Tested-by: Stefan Bürk <stefan@buerk.tech>Reviewed-by: Benjamin Franzke <ben@bnf.dev>Reviewed-by: Benjamin Kott <benjamin.kott@outlook.com>",1

"datapath: Fix ICMP ID placement in CT entries The [1] changed the ICMP ECHO/ECHO_REPLY ID placement in CT entries inorder to fix the problem when an egress NAT entry for ECHO_REPLY cannotbe found by a corresponding CT entry which lead to leaking NAT entries,as the CT GC could not find the NAT entries by the given CT entry.The changed placement introduced an interesting problem described below.What happens when a pod (10.154.0.89) sends ICMP EchoRequest to 8.8.8.8?A CT entry with the following key is created:dst         src          dport sport    TUPLE_F_OUT|           |            |     |        |0a 9a 00 59 08 08 08 08  00 00 08 00 01 00 <-- dst=pod because of					       the reverse before the                                               second __ct_lookup.(""ICMP OUT 10.154.0.89:2048 -> 8.8.8.8:0 [...]"" in the""cilium bpf ct list global"" output).What happens when 8.8.8.8 sends ICMP EchoRequest to the pod? The lookupis performed for the reverse flow first with the following key:dst         src          dport sport    TUPLE_F_OUT <-- dir is TUPLE_F_OUT|           |            |     |        |               because we do the0a 9a 00 59 08 08 08 08  00 00 08 00 01 00              lookup in reverse							order first.The key matches the first __ct_lookup(), hence the return is CT_REPLY.Previously, before the changed ID placement, the CT key for 8.8.8.8 ->the pod lookup was:0a 9a 00 59 08 08 08 08  08 00 00 00 01 00This resulted in CT_NEW instead of CT_REPLY.[1]: #12729Signed-off-by: Martynas Pumputis <m@lambda.lt>",1

"io: check for EOF when decoding a gzip stream (CVE-2021-20319) Under normal conditions, GzDecoder doesn't read EOF from the underlyingsource; it stops reading as soon as it reaches the gzip trailer.  Sincethe wrapped GpgReader doesn't see EOF, it doesn't check the exit status ofGPG, and a bad signature will not be noticed.  XzDecoder is not affected.This allows bypass of signature verification under uncommon circumstances.Notably, installing from a live ISO or PXE image uses either osmet images(Fedora CoreOS or RHEL CoreOS) or a full copy of the install image (RHEL forEdge), and these are not affected because they're trusted (they come fromthe installation media we've booted from).  These flows are affected:1.  Installing with --image-file, --image-url, or coreos.inst.image_url.For example, if a user has a local mirror of installation images, anattacker could replace an image with a gzip-compressed alternative (evenif the file extension is .xz).  The result:$ coreos-installer install --image-url http://localhost:8080/image.xz /dev/loop0Downloading image from http://localhost:8080/image.xzDownloading signature from http://localhost:8080/image.xz.sig> Read disk 749.9 MiB/749.9 MiB (100%)gpg: Signature made Mon 20 Sep 2021 02:41:50 PM EDTgpg: using RSA key 8C5BA6990BDB26E19F2A1A801161AE6945719A39gpg: BAD signature from ""Fedora (34) <fedora-34-primary@fedoraproject.org>"" [ultimate]Install complete.GPG still complains when its stdin is closed, but coreos-installer doesn'tnotice.

If that also returns EOF, great, and we've given the source anopportunity to do its own EOF processing.  If not, fail, because the streamcontains trailing garbage.Also add unit tests for signature verification and for detection of badsignatures in the fetch pipeline.Requires the previous commit.Bug discovered by @raballew; thanks!",1

"Use random input for numerical tests in convert_tf_quant_to_mhlo_int_testThis CL adds helper functions to generate random input and compare test results.I found that TF kernels and the lowering pass have different round schemes for quantize/rescaling etc: floor(x+0.5) vs round_nearest_even. So there maybe +/-1 errors. The lowering pass uses the latter, which is consistent with TF quantizer. (Requantize in TF kernel doesn't use the former, thus the good agreement).Therefore I removed most Q/DQ pairs in test cases so that they don't interfere with the evaluation of other ops.PiperOrigin-RevId: 575992943",1

"ssh: require host key checking in the ClientConfig This change breaks existing behavior.Before, a missing ClientConfig.HostKeyCallback would cause host keychecking to be disabled. In this configuration, establishing aconnection to any host just works, so today, most SSH client code inthe wild does not perform any host key checks.This makes it easy to perform a MITM attack:* SSH installations that use keyboard-interactive or passwordauthentication can be attacked with MITM, thereby stealingpasswords.* Clients that use public-key authentication with agent forwarding arealso vulnerable: the MITM server could allow the login to succeed, andthen immediately ask the agent to authenticate the login to the realserver.* Clients that use public-key authentication without agent forwardingare harder to attack unnoticedly: an attacker cannot authenticate thelogin to the real server, so it cannot in general present a convincingserver to the victim.Now, a missing HostKeyCallback will cause the handshake to fail. Thischange also provides InsecureIgnoreHostKey() and FixedHostKey(key) asready made host checkers.A simplistic parser for OpenSSH's known_hosts file is given as anexample.  This change does not provide a full-fledged parser, as ithas complexity (wildcards, revocation, hashed addresses) that willneed further consideration.When introduced, the host checking feature maintained backwardcompatibility at the expense of security. We have decided this is notthe right tradeoff for the SSH library.Fixes golang/go#19767Change-Id: I45fc7ba9bd1ea29c31ec23f115cdbab99913e814Reviewed-on: https://go-review.googlesource.com/38701Run-TryBot: Han-Wen Nienhuys <hanwen@google.com>TryBot-Result: Gobot Gobot <gobot@golang.org>Reviewed-by: Brad Fitzpatrick <bradfitz@golang.org>",1

"# Absolute Path Traversal due to incorrect use of `send_file` call (#… …2025)A path traversal attack (also known as directory traversal) aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the web root folder. By manipulating variables that reference files with “dot-dot-slash (../)” sequences and its variations or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system including application source code or configuration and critical system files. This attack is also known as “dot-dot-slash”, “directory traversal”, “directory climbing” and “backtracking”.## Common Weakness Enumeration categoryCWE - 36## Root Cause AnalysisThe `os.path.join` call is unsafe for use with untrusted input. When the `os.path.join` call encounters an absolute path, it ignores all the parameters it has encountered till that point and starts working with the new absolute path.  Please see the example below.```>>> import os.path>>> static = ""path/to/mySafeStaticDir"">>> malicious = ""/../../../../../etc/passwd"">>> os.path.join(t,malicious)'/../../../../../etc/passwd'```Since the ""malicious"" parameter represents an absolute path, the result of `os.path.join` ignores the static directory completely. Hence, untrusted input is passed via the `os.path.join` call to `flask.send_file` can lead to path traversal attacks.In this case, the problems occurs due to the following code :https://github.com/ganga-devs/ganga/blob/0c0f9e33b36ee7ead0855f1464f8d4efad26bdbc/ganga/GangaGUI/gui/routes.py#L671Here, the `path` parameter is attacker controlled. This parameter passes through the unsafe `os.path.join` call making the effective directory and filename passed to the `send_file` call attacker controlled. This leads to a path traversal attack.## Proof of ConceptThe bug can be verified using a proof of concept similar to the one shown below.```curl --path-as-is 'http://<domain>/job/<int:job_id>/browse///../../../../etc/passwd""'```## RemediationThis can be fixed by preventing flow of untrusted data to the vulnerable `send_file` function. In case the application logic necessiates this behaviour, one can either use the `werkzeug.utils.safe_join` to join untrusted paths or replace `flask.send_file` calls with `flask.send_from_directory` calls.## Common Vulnerability Scoring System VectorThe attack can be carried over the network. A complex non-standard configuration or a specialized condition is not required for the attack to be successfully conducted. There is no user interaction required for successful execution. The attack can affect components outside the scope of the target module. The attack can be used to gain access to confidential files like passwords, login credentials and other secrets. It cannot be directly used to affect a change on a system resource. Hence has limited to no impact on integrity. Using this attack vector a attacker may make multiple requests for accessing huge files such as a database. This can lead to a partial system denial service. However, the impact on availability is quite low in this case. Taking this account an appropriate CVSS v3.1 vector would be(AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L)[https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L&version=3.1]This gives it a base score of 9.3/10 and a severity rating of critical.## References* [OWASP Path Traversal](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal)* github/securitylab#669### This bug was found using *[CodeQL by Github](https://codeql.github.com/)*Co-authored-by: Porcupiney Hairs <porucpiney.hairs@protonmail.com>",1

"[BUGFIX] Generate correct asset symlinks on WindowsThis patch fixes two issues when generating symlinks to the publicextension resources (Public/Resources) into the _assets folder duringComposer installation.First, directory symlinks can't be created the same way on Windows ason Unix platforms. The creation requires elevated rights, and therequired command is named differently as well. Junctions should be usedon Windows instead, because they do not need elevated privileges to becreated.When installing a TYPO3 extension via Composer, its Resources/Publicfolder is getting symlinked to the publicly accessible _assets folder.Until now, this process only used the Unix specific functions providedby Composer. It did not create any symlinks on Windows basedinstallations, without generating any error message.This patch adds the same checks and platform-specific functions used byComposer when symlinking packages from a local path repository.The second issue that has been addressed is the naming of the symlinksthemselves. When a Resources/Public directory is symlinked into the_assets folder, the symlink will be named using an md5 hash based onparts of the extension's installation path on the filesystem. DuringComposer installation, this relative path is derived from theabsolute path provided by Composer. As Windows uses a different defaultpath separator (backslash) compared to Unix (forward slash), therelative path will be different between both platforms, resulting in adifferent md5 hash being generated.Absolute path on Unix:/path/to/typo3/vendor/mycompany/myextAbsolute path on Windows:C:\path\to\typo3\vendor/mycompany/myextRelative path to be used for the hash on Unix:/vendor/mycompany/myextRelative path to be used for the hash on Windows:\vendor/mycompany/myextIf an uri into the _assets folder is to be generated in either frontendor backend, the md5 hash will be always be generated by using forwardslashes, resulting in incorrect links on Windows installations.This difference has been solved by replacing all backslashes in theabsolute extension installation path into forward slashes on Windowsinstallations, so the symlink will be named correctly from thebeginning.Resolves: #98434Resolves: #98447Releases: main, 12.4, 11.5Change-Id: I221eb538312302a7af4f7c3010c9982922f1c6ceReviewed-on: https://review.typo3.org/c/Packages/TYPO3.CMS/+/75867Reviewed-by: Nicole Cordes <typo3@cordes.co>Tested-by: Stefan B�rk <stefan@buerk.tech>Tested-by: Christian Kuhn <lolli@schwarzbu.ch>Tested-by: core-ci <typo3@b13.com>Reviewed-by: Stefan B�rk <stefan@buerk.tech>Reviewed-by: Christian Kuhn <lolli@schwarzbu.ch>Tested-by: Nicole Cordes <typo3@cordes.co>",1

"[SECURITY] Prevent XSS due to wrong PATH_INFO evaluation As already started in #88304 (but only for NormalizedParams)and later reverted in #89312 (because of cgi-bin problems),PATH_INFO is no longer considered as a preferable SCRIPT_NAMEalternative. All known server configurations set SCRIPT_NAMEthese days to a proper value when cgi.fix_pathinfo is set.The fallback to PATH_INFO has been introduced withthe initial revision of TYPO3 and isn't needed at all nowadays,it's actually wrong, as a REQUEST_URI like /index.php/foo/barwould incorrectly be interpreted as $scriptName == ""/foo/bar"",which let's all calculations on $scriptName fail andeven leads to XSS where values derived from $scriptName areprinted without being escaped.Also any ORIG_SCRIPT_NAME evaluation is dropped, as this variablecontains the SCRIPT_NAME that was set by the webserver configurationbefore PHP applied cgi.fix_pathinfo. Using ORIG_SCRIPT_NAMEeffectively meant bypassing PHP's pathinfo fix. It usually containsthe cgi-wrapper paths, which is why PATH_INFO was used to overrulewrong ORIG_SCRIPT_NAME values.GeneralUtility::getIndpEnv('PATH_INFO') is adapted to trust theservers PATH_INFO information, now that we no longer allowservers to send SCRIPT_NAME as PATH_INFO (we enforcecgi.fix_pathinfo=1 for CGI installations).The normalized SCRIPT_NAME is now adapted to be encoded as a URLpath by default, as all TYPO3 usages expect this to be an URL path.Note that $_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME'] refers to the servers filesystem path, not the URL encoded value.This SCRIPT_NAME sanitization actually enables:a) TYPO3 to be run in a subfolder that contains charactersthat need URL encodinge.g. `/test:site/` – url encoded that'd be `/test3Asite/`.b) prevention of XSS in case third party extensionsmissed to escape any URL that is derived from SCRIPT_NAME(while making sure that properly escapedoutput is not double escaped)Resolves: #99651Related: #88304Related: #89312Releases: main, 11.5, 10.4Change-Id: Ief95253d764665db5182a15ce8ffd02ea02ee61eSecurity-Bulletin: TYPO3-CORE-SA-2023-001Security-References: CVE-2023-24814Reviewed-on: https://review.typo3.org/c/Packages/TYPO3.CMS/+/77739Tested-by: Oliver Hader <oliver.hader@typo3.org>Reviewed-by: Oliver Hader <oliver.hader@typo3.org>",1

PNG files offer many benefits, one of them being fastergeneration using image processors.We previously held back on removing this setting because thetemporary images using gdlib_png were significantly darker thanthe GIF files, but this stems from the TYPO3 default configurationusing the RGB colorspace (if nothing else is set) in combinationwith ImageMagick. The sRGB colorspace, as recommended in the preset,should be used.If GraphicsMagick is used, generating temporary images using the RGBcolorspace works fine.With this knowledge it is safe to remove the setting, but a migrationnotice has been left notifying users of each image processor ofrequired migration steps.Resolves: #102020Releases: mainChange-Id: I4be795406cbb010d4b668a2de588c4591c443cf3Reviewed-on: https://review.typo3.org/c/Packages/TYPO3.CMS/+/81184Tested-by: Stefan Bürk <stefan@buerk.tech>Tested-by: Andreas Fernandez <a.fernandez@scripting-base.de>Tested-by: core-ci <typo3@b13.com>Reviewed-by: Andreas Fernandez <a.fernandez@scripting-base.de>Reviewed-by: Stefan Bürk <stefan@buerk.tech>",0

"[TASK] Improve CKEditor vendor logo placementWith CKEditor v38.0.0 a small ""Powered by CKEditor"" logo has been addedto the bottom right of the editor component. The logo is visible as soonas the CKEditor component receives the focus. The current placement ofthe logo does however overlay the border of the editor component and theterm ""Powered by"" does not suit well to the TYPO3 backend.With this change, the CKEditor configuration has been extended, so it isnow possible to configure `config.ui.*` settings. The `Base.yaml` filehas been extended with CKEditor UI specific settings, which remove theterm ""Powered by"" from the logo and which optimize the logo placement,so it appears in the bottom right corner of the editor component withoutoverlaying the border.Resolves: #101759Releases: main, 12.4Signed-off-by: Torben Hansen <derhansen@gmail.com>Change-Id: Ic35054a92c7101fac9381e1476c214ffad3e0465Reviewed-on: https://review.typo3.org/c/Packages/TYPO3.CMS/+/80699Tested-by: Jasmina Lie�mann <minapokhalo+typo3@gmail.com>Reviewed-by: Benjamin Franzke <ben@bnf.dev>Tested-by: core-ci <typo3@b13.com>Reviewed-by: Thomas Hohn <tho@gyldendal.dk>Tested-by: Benjamin Franzke <ben@bnf.dev>Reviewed-by: Jasmina Lie�mann <minapokhalo+typo3@gmail.com>",0

"[TASK] Suggest PHP exif module in system environment statusIf the PHP exif module is installed, TYPO3 uses the `exif_read_data()`function of read exif metadata of images. In case of the image uploadfunctionality in TYPO3, the `exif_read_data()` function is used toevaluate the `Orientation` exif property, which is used to decide, ifthe width and height of an image should be switched before the datais saved in the `sys_file_metadata` table. If the PHP exif module isnot available, portrait images created by modern camera systems mightbe saved with wrong width and height, because the exif `Orientation`is not respected. This might result in rending of distorted images,when the uploaded image is processed by TYPO3 image rendering.With this change, the system environment check is extended tosuggest to PHP exif module to be installed.

"Fix temporary directory hijacking or temporary directory information … …disclosure (#1621)This replaces and closes #1617.Fix a vulnerability which allows a malicious user access files created in a temp directory if it was created using IOUtils.createTempDir.  The implementation has been changed to use the more secure Files.createTemporaryDirectory(). This has a side effect of making the second ""suffix"" argument no longer usable and it is now simply appended to the existing prefix.  Deprecating IOUtils.createTempDir(String, String) and adding a new single argument version instead which returns a Path.This potentially exposed data created by CoordinateSortedPairInfoMaps on shared systems to a malicious users with access to the global temp directory.  It is recommended that user upgrade if they use CoordinateSortedPairInfoMap or IOUTils.createTempDir() in their code.* vuln-fix: Temporary Directory Hijacking or Information DisclosureThis fixes either Temporary Directory Hijacking, or Temporary Directory Local Information Disclosure.Weakness: CWE-379: Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure PermissionsSeverity: HighCVSSS: 7.3Detection: CodeQL & OpenRewrite (https://public.moderne.io/recipes/org.openrewrite.java.security.UseFilesCreateTempDirectory)Reported-by: Jonathan Leitschuh <Jonathan.Leitschuh@gmail.com>Signed-off-by: Jonathan Leitschuh <Jonathan.Leitschuh@gmail.com>Bug-tracker: JLLeitschuh/security-research#10Co-authored-by: Jonathan Leitschuh <Jonathan.Leitschuh@gmail.com>Co-authored-by: Moderne <team@moderne.io>",1

"MDL-79637 phpunit: Do not reset DB during init of isolated testsDuring the bootstrap of PHPUnit we ensure that the database has beenreset to its initial state.We do this by checking the internally-stored DB write count betweenruns. If the count is not yet set (null), or it has been increased, weforce a reset.When running an isolated test the test runner resets the database, itthen sets up a new isolated test environment by writing a new PHPUnittest case and passing it to a new PHP Process using standard in. As partof this, the bootstrap is run for that process.Because we are in a new process, the db write count is fresh and not yetset. This has been leading to an additional db reset before the isolatedtest.To handle this we want to _not_ perform a reset during theinitialisation for isolated runs. We know that the DB is in a freshstate before we start the run.To support this we need to know whether the test is an isolated testduring the bootstrap, which means we cannot use the previous approach tocalculating this.Instead we look at the PHP_SELF value. PHP sets this to ""Standard inputcode"" when run from stdin, instead of running a file.There should not be any other legitimate reason to run a PHPUnitbootstrap via this stdin approach.Unfortunately this approach is a little bit risky as it depends on thepresence of a specific string, however this string has been in placesince 2016, and there is no legitimate way of calculating this.I did consider looking at whether the called script included `/vendor/`and `/phpunit`, but this is also likely a risky approach if someonecalls PHPUnit in an unexpected way.This approach is itself unit tested so any change to PHP's stdin stringbefore we deprecate this approach entirely in 12 months time will becaught.",1

"Implement nullish coalescing operatorThis operator is similar to the logical or operator (`||`) but is meant to avoid unintended behavior which might arise when using logical or. Problem with logical or is that the left argument is coerced to a boolean which means that if it is something falsy (like `0`, `''`, or `false`) then the right argument will be used instead.The coalescing operator (`??`) is designed to solve this problem. It only assigns the right value when the left value is `null` or `undefined`.```javascriptnull || 'something'; // 'something'undefined || 'something'; // 'something''' || 'something'; // 'something'0 || 'something'; // 'something'false || 'something'; // 'something'null ??

"[MERGE #6247 @zenparsing] Insert a ByteCodeUses instr for arguments when inlining apply targetMerge pull request #6247 from zenparsing:inline-apply-target-bugWhen inline apply target optimization is used for:```jsinlinee.apply(obj, arguments);```a bailout will occur if the target function is not the expected inlinee. When this occurs, the arguments object needs to be created for use in the interpreter. Currently, GlobOpt is not correctly tracking that the arguments object symbol is needed by the interpreter, and the arguments object is not getting added to the associated bailout info.This PR adds a `ByteCodeUses` instr for this inlining case.Additional changes:- Explicit initialization for the `m_nonEscapingArgObjAlias` field of StackSym.- `Src2` is no longer used for `BytecodeArgOutUse` (GlobOpt was not checking Src2)",1

"Open bind mount sources from the host userns The source of the bind mount might not be accessible in a different usernamespace because a component of the source path might not be traversedunder the users and groups mapped inside the user namespace. This causederrors such as the following:  # time=""2020-06-22T13:48:26Z"" level=error msg=""container_linux.go:367:  starting container process caused: process_linux.go:459:  container init caused: rootfs_linux.go:58:  mounting \""/tmp/busyboxtest/source-inaccessible/dir\""  to rootfs at \""/tmp/inaccessible\"" caused:  stat /tmp/busyboxtest/source-inaccessible/dir: permission denied""To solve this problem, this patch performs the following:1. in nsexec.c, it opens the source path in the host userns (so we have   the right permissions to open it) but in the container mntns (so the   kernel cross mntns mount check let us mount it later:   https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v5.8/fs/namespace.c#L2312).2. in nsexec.c, it passes the file descriptors of the source to the   child process with SCM_RIGHTS.3. In runc-init in Golang, it finishes the mounts while inside the   userns even without access to the some components of the source   paths.Passing the fds with SCM_RIGHTS is necessary because once the childprocess is in the container mntns, it is already in the container usernsso it cannot temporarily join the host mntns.This patch uses the existing mechanism with _LIBCONTAINER_* environmentvariables to pass the file descriptors from runc to runc init.This patch uses the existing mechanism with the Netlink-style bootstrapto pass information about the list of source mounts to nsexec.c.Rootless containers don't use this bind mount sources fdpassingmechanism because we can't setns() to the target mntns in a rootlesscontainer (we don't have the privileges when we are in the host userns).This patch takes care of using O_CLOEXEC on mount fds, and close themearly.Fixes: #2484.Signed-off-by: Alban Crequy <alban@kinvolk.io>Signed-off-by: Rodrigo Campos <rodrigo@kinvolk.io>Co-authored-by: Rodrigo Campos <rodrigo@kinvolk.io>",1

"Revert eroneous change to JsGetAndClearExceptionWIthMetadata (#6412)Revert an erroneous edit made to JsGetAndClearExceptionWIthMetadata. And bring behaviour of this API back inline with version 1.11.This relates to logic used for obtaining the source of the line of Js which generated the exception. This specific path is followed only when the error is on the last line of the script. In that case the line is measured by doing:Obtain offset of the start of the line (characters/bytes from start of script to beginning of erroring line)Obtain offset for end of the script (full size of script)Work out the difference between the twoThe error was that the output of (1) was being added to (2) - then upon working out the difference the result was always the full size of the script, not the length of the last line as wanted.Note I have not added a test case for this as it would be rather complicated and this code is only used in this API and not for any other purpose - a better mechanism for testing some of these APIs should be developed at a later date.Fix: #6408",1

"Use Files.createTempFile(...) to ensure the file is created with prop… …er permissionsMotivation:File.createTempFile(String, String)` will create a temporary file in the system temporary directory if the 'java.io.tmpdir'. The permissions on that file utilize the umask. In a majority of cases, this means that the file that java creates has the permissions: `-rw-r--r--`, thus, any other local user on that system can read the contents of that file.This can be a security concern if any sensitive data is stored in this file.This was reported by Jonathan Leitschuh <jonathan.leitschuh@gmail.com> as a security problem.Modifications:Use Files.createTempFile(...) which will use safe-defaults when running on java 7 and later. If running on java 6 there isnt much we can do, which is fair enough as java 6 shouldnt be considered ""safe"" anyway.Result:Create temporary files with sane permissions by default.",1

internal scope contains unofficial and undocumented fields (prefixed with underscore `_`) which are used internally by Parse Server; you may want to manipulate these fields for out-of-band changes such as data migration or correction tasks; changes within the internal scope of Parse Server may happen at any time without notice or changelog entry, it is therefore recommended to look at the source code of Parse Server to understand the effects of manipulating internal fields before using the key; it is discouraged to use the `maintenanceKey` for routine operations in a production environment; see [access scopes](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server#access-scopes) ([#8212](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/issues/8212))

The Docker image does not contain the git dependency anymore; if you have been using git as a transitive dependency it now needs to be explicitly installed in your Docker file, for example with `RUN apk --no-cache add git` (#8359) ([40810b4](40810b4))* Fields in the internal scope of Parse Server (prefixed with underscore `_`) are only returned using the new `maintenanceKey`; previously the `masterKey` allowed reading of internal fields; see [access scopes](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server#access-scopes) for a comparison of the keys' access permissions (#8212) ([f3bcc93](f3bcc93))* The method `ParseServer.verifyServerUrl` now returns a promise instead of a callback. ([ffa4974](ffa4974))* The MongoDB aggregation pipeline requires native MongoDB syntax instead of the custom Parse Server syntax; for example pipeline stage names require a leading dollar sign like `$match` and the MongoDB document ID is referenced using `_id` instead of `objectId` (#8362) ([d0d30c4](d0d30c4))* The mechanism to determine the client IP address has been rewritten; to correctly determine the IP address it is now required to set the Parse Server option `trustProxy` accordingly if Parse Server runs behind a proxy server, see the express framework's [trust proxy](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/behind-proxies.html) setting (#8372) ([892040d](892040d))* The Node Package Manager lock file `package-lock.json` is upgraded to version 2; while it is backwards with version 1 for the npm installer, consider this if you run any non-npm analysis tools that use the lock file (#8285) ([ee72467](ee72467))* This release introduces the asynchronous initialization of Parse Server to prevent mounting Parse Server before being ready to receive request; it changes how Parse Server is imported, initialized and started; it also removes the callback `serverStartComplete`; see the [Parse Server 6 migration guide](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/blob/alpha/6.0.0.md) for more details (#8232) ([99fcf45](99fcf45))* Nested objects are now properly stored in the database using JSON serialization; previously, due to a bug only top-level objects were serialized, but nested objects were saved as raw JSON; for example, a nested `Date` object was saved as a JSON object like `{ ""__type"": ""Date"", ""iso"": ""2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"" }` instead of its serialized representation `2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z` (#8209) ([1412666](1412666))* The Parse Server option `enforcePrivateUsers` is set to `true` by default; in previous releases this option defaults to `false`; this change improves the default security configuration of Parse Server (#8283) ([ed499e3](ed499e3))* This release restricts the use of `masterKey` to localhost by default; if you are using Parse Dashboard on a different server to connect to Parse Server you need to add the IP address of the server that hosts Parse Dashboard to this option (#8281) ([6c16021](6c16021))* This release upgrades to Redis 4; if you are using the Redis cache adapter with Parse Server then this is a breaking change as the Redis client options have changed; see the [Redis migration guide](https://github.com/redis/node-redis/blob/redis%404.0.0/docs/v3-to-v4.md) for more details (#8293) ([7d622f0](7d622f0))* This release removes support for MongoDB 4.0; the new minimum supported MongoDB version is 4.2. which also removes support for the deprecated MongoDB MMAPv1 storage engine ([37245f6](37245f6))* Throwing an error in Cloud Code Triggers `afterLogin`, `afterLogout` returns a rejected promise; in previous releases it crashed the server if you did not handle the error on the Node.js process level; consider adapting your code if your app currently handles these errors on the Node.js process level with `process.on('unhandledRejection', ...)` ([130d290](130d290))* Config option `directAccess` defaults to true; set this to `false` in environments where multiple Parse Server instances run behind a load balancer and Parse requests within the current Node.js environment should be routed via the load balancer and distributed as HTTP requests among all instances via the `serverURL`. ([f535ee6](f535ee6))* The convenience method for HTTP requests `Parse.Cloud.httpRequest` is removed; use your preferred 3rd party library for making HTTP requests ([2d79c08](2d79c08))* This release removes Node 12 and Node 17 support ([2546cc8](2546cc8))",1

Do this to avoid conflicts with the (pre)viewrepresentation of the contents which may not represent the plain data 1:1.Examples: * CKEditor5 renderes phone links in the editor preview as `href=""#""`.   That means `href` must not be parsed from the link (#101303). * Link classes may be alterated with stateful style classes   and had therefore be filtered server side previously (#101959).   This is workaround could now be removed.To make it clear that the result of getSelectedLinkElement() mustnot be used as data source, the (more) correct return type`ViewAttributeElement` is defined now (upstream does so too).Note that CKEditor5 uses commands somewhat like data-models,where the data is to be collected in the refresh() method.This is why we process all link-related registered attribute in there,(based on the CKEditor5 schema).Releases: main, 12.4Resolves: #101303Related: #101959Change-Id: I04ee9a07c7444cd197f70d658e856d6824254020Reviewed-on: https://review.typo3.org/c/Packages/TYPO3.CMS/+/81266Tested-by: core-ci <typo3@b13.com>Tested-by: Benjamin Kott <benjamin.kott@outlook.com>Tested-by: Benjamin Franzke <ben@bnf.dev>Reviewed-by: Benjamin Franzke <ben@bnf.dev>Reviewed-by: Andreas Fernandez <a.fernandez@scripting-base.de>Tested-by: Andreas Fernandez <a.fernandez@scripting-base.de>Reviewed-by: Benjamin Kott <benjamin.kott@outlook.com>",1

"Mark `MemmappedTensorAllocator` as returning opaque handle. This allocator is used for `ImmutableConstantOp` and it returns a handle to the contents of a memory mapped file which is supposed to represent a tensor.For tensors of complex types (resources, variables and strings), allocators which are not marked as returning opaque handles will call placement new to initialize each element. This means writing to the buffer. However, in our case, the buffer is immutable and already contains the tensor data. Hence, writing to it is both destructive and causes a crash.PiperOrigin-RevId: 345786451Change-Id: I46369c50fa60b3431709ffe068a728d3061f49c4",1

"vuln-fix: Zip Slip Vulnerability This fixes a Zip-Slip vulnerability.This change does one of two things. This change either1. Inserts a guard to protect against Zip Slip.OR2. Replaces `dir.getCanonicalPath().startsWith(parent.getCanonicalPath())`, which is vulnerable to partial path traversal attacks, with the more secure `dir.getCanonicalFile().toPath().startsWith(parent.getCanonicalFile().toPath())`.For number 2, consider `""/usr/outnot"".startsWith(""/usr/out"")`.The check is bypassed although `/outnot` is not under the `/out` directory.It's important to understand that the terminating slash may be removed when using various `String` representations of the `File` object.For example, on Linux, `println(new File(""/var""))` will print `/var`, but `println(new File(""/var"", ""/"")` will print `/var/`;however, `println(new File(""/var"", ""/"").getCanonicalPath())` will print `/var`.Weakness: CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')Severity: HighCVSSS: 7.4Detection: CodeQL (https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/java/java-zipslip/) & OpenRewrite (https://public.moderne.io/recipes/org.openrewrite.java.security.ZipSlip)Reported-by: Jonathan Leitschuh <Jonathan.Leitschuh@gmail.com>Signed-off-by: Jonathan Leitschuh <Jonathan.Leitschuh@gmail.com>Bug-tracker: JLLeitschuh/security-research#16Co-authored-by: Moderne <team@moderne.io>",1
